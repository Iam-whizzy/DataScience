If the IADB did the same, Camisea would be left short of cash and Peru would lack a key international seal of approval for the landmark project. \\n“We … are writing to urge you to take immediate steps to ensure that our tax dollars not contribute to the wholesale destruction of one of the planet’s most biodiverse and remote rainforests and to the demise of vulnerable indigenous populations,” said the letter, released by environmental groups Amazon Watch and Friends of the Earth. \\nUncontacted tribes\\nPeru is counting on the $1.6 billion Camisea project, which is being developed by an Argentine-led consortium, to boost growth by nearly one percentage point and create 40,000 jobs. \\nIt plans to extract gas from an Amazon field 1200 km south of Lima, an area home to some of the last uncontacted tribes and untouched rainforests on earth. \\nTwo 800 km pipelines, now 70% built, will cross the Andes to a plant on the fringes of the Paracas coastal nature reserve, a playground for sea lions and rare penguins and a major tourist attraction. \\nFrom there, one pipeline will run to Lima, supplying gas by August 2004, the government says. \\nDisaster in the making\\n\\n\\nPeru says it has done everything by the book to minimise Camisea’s environmental impact, has held 18 public hearings and has studied 14 alternative sites for the Paracas plant. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We have to hope that the voices of reason will be heard rather than the voices of ruthless oil and gas companies”\\nBianca Jagger,Rights campaigner\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEconomy Minister Jaime Quijandria said talks were continuing with the IADB and “we think things are going well.” \\nBut Bianca Jagger, rights campaigner and ex-wife of Rolling Stones star Mick Jagger, called Camisea “a disaster in the making” that would sully the IADB if it approved the loan. \\n“We have to hope that the voices of reason will be heard rather than the voices of ruthless oil and gas companies … all they want is profit,” she told Reuters. She has written to Peru’s President Alejandro Toledo urging a Camisea rethink. \\nDestined for California\\n“We understand that much of the gas extracted from Camisea is destined for electricity markets in California,” the letter said. “We feel sure that if the consumers in California knew about the high social and ecological costs of natural gas from the Peruvian Amazon, they would be highly opposed to it.” \\nAtossa Soltani, executive director of Amazon Watch, said that three of the four well sites were located inside the Nahua Kugapakori Indigenous Reserve, which was established by the government to protect the Nahua, Nanti and Kirineri tribes which live in voluntary isolation. \\n“70% of the Nahua died in the 1980s when the Nahua were contacted by Shell,” Soltani said.

It is but one of the many frontiers in aeronautics that remain to be explored.” \\nShock waves\\nA plane flying through the atmosphere continuously produces waves similar to those created by the bow of a ship in water, NASA said in a statement. \\nWhen the plane exceeds the speed of sound – about 1200 km per hour at sea level – the pressure waves merge to form shock waves, a sonic boom usually heard as an explosion or loud rifle shot when it reaches the ground. \\nFor the trials, Northrop Grumman modified an F-5E navy combat jet with a specially shaped “nose glove,” and added aluminum substructure and a composite skin to the underside of the fuselage. \\nThe results showed a sonic boom appreciably reduced in intensity from that of a similar unmodified plane, said NASA. \\n',\n",

Still more spoke of the bureaucratic nightmare involved in navigating the subcontract bidding process. \\nFiling the necessary paperwork is challenging enough they say, getting phone calls returned by contracting giants such as Halliburton and Bechtel is nearly impossible.\\nSmaller companies, like American Bio-Med Ambulette, Inc., a medical supply company in Brooklyn, New York with only 18 employees, said it’s been difficult to distinguish themselves from the thousands of other firms chasing subcontracts.\\nA touch of independence\\n“We’ve registered with Bechtel and Halliburton, and so far we’ve heard nothing, so we figured ‘let’s get down here,’ ” said Fritz-Earle Mclymont, the company’s marketing director. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIraqi firemen inspect a blazing pipeline near the northern Iraqi town of Beji.\\n\\n\\n\\nIraqi firemen inspect a blazing pipeline near the northern Iraqi town of Beji.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMclymont said the biggest stumbling block thus far has been “getting through the bureaucracy and making things happen.”\\nEven companies that have done work in the past for the major contractors like Halliburton said it’s been a struggle to make it out of the starting gate. \\n“There’s too many people who are after [Halliburton] for business and information, so they don’t have the time for people,” said Reyad Hijazi, managing partner for the Al-Julaiah Trading &amp; Contracting Co., a Kuwaiti company that has previously done business with a Halliburton subsidiary.\\nHijazi said he hopes to win a KBR subcontract to repair the electric motors that were damaged during the war.\\nLow expectations\\nFew, if any, of the company representatives at the conference, expected to win a contract on the spot—that’s not why they came.\\n“I don’t think I’m going to get any contract doing this,” said Sebastian Joseph, the operational manager for International Popular Co., a food service and laundry equipment supplier in Kuwait. \\nEven the bigger companies seemed realistic about their prospects. Paul McGarry, who works for the Rittal Corporation, a metal parts firm in Columbus, OH, whose German parent company boasts roughly $2 billion a year in sales, said he “didn’t expect to get a lot of bites here.” \\nInstead, McGarry said he wanted to get a better sense of who’s doing what with whom.\\nWho and what\\n“What I would expect to come out of this conference is to learn the companies that have been awarded contracts and who they’re awarding subcontracts,” he said. \\nWhether or not the conference will produce any tangible benefits attendees is unclear. But Unnithan said there remains an immense gap between talk and action.\\n“I think that there are only ideas at this conference,” he said. “To bring something to reality will take a lot of time.”\\n',\n",
              "       'Wilson said multiple sources told him two senior White House aides leaked the story to Washington Post columnist Robert Novak in retaliation for going public with what he knew about the false weapons claims made by President George Bush during his State of the Union address.\\nIf allegations about the leak are true, Wilson said Karl Rove, the president’s top political strategist, must have authorised it. “I happen to believe that Karl Rove either approved or at a minimum, condoned it,” he said.\\nWilson has refused to confirm or deny assertions about his wife’s CIA connections, but noted that any public disclosure of a secret agent would constitute a criminal violation of the Intelligence Identify Protection Act.\\nSenator Charles Schumer, D-NY, has called for an FBI investigation of the matter, and Wilson said he would do whatever he could to assist any such investigation. \\nSpeaking at a recent symposium in Seattle, WA, he said that if Rove played a part in leaking the story, he should be taken out of the White House “in handcuffs.”\\nPolitical controversy\\nWhen he first heard President Bush utter the now infamous 16 words about Saddam Hussein’s attempt to purchase uranium in West Africa, Wilson said he never imagined the political controversy that would soon follow.\\nWilson, a former US ambassador to Gabon, holds the distinction of being the last American official to meet Saddam Hussein, so he knows a thing or two about what the former Iraqi president is capable of. He believed it was likely that Iraq was harbouring chemical and biological agents of some kind. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoseph Wilson was the last US officialto meet Saddam Hussein\\n\\n\\n\\nJoseph Wilson was the last US officialto meet Saddam Hussein\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe knew that Hussein had been pursuing a nuclear weapons programme for decades, so Bush’s vague assertion during his State of the Union address in January — in which he mentioned no specifics about the Iraq-Africa connection — seemed reasonable, if not infallible.\\nWhat he didn’t know was that the most controversial line of the speech was largely based on faulty British intelligence stating that Iraq had tried to buy large amounts of uranium from the tiny West African nation of Niger. \\nIt was a claim Wilson dispelled after being sent to Niger by the Central Intelligence Agency in February 2002 to verify the information. Upon returning to Washington, DC, he told CIA officials that based on his investigation, there was no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the charges were true. \\nYet somehow the intelligence, including what turned out to be forged documents, found its way into the US National Intelligence Estimate, and ultimately into President Bush’s State of the Union address, during which he made a blistering case for the invasion of Iraq.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I felt that it was important because of the confusion about it, and the fact that the story was spinning out of control” \\nJoseph Wilson, former US ambassador\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the weeks and months leading to up to the war, Wilson watched and waited. He knew that weapons of mass destruction might very well be discovered. He saw no reason to point fingers before the Bush administration had the time to prove that its case for pre-emptive military action was fully justified. \\nHe gave several interviews to the media, but would only provide anonymous statements that the intelligence community had overreached on the uranium claims.\\nHe argued that the US should have devoted more energy to supporting UN weapons inspections, rather than launching air strikes on Baghdad. The war came and went, with coalition forces destroying the Iraqi army in a few short weeks of combat. The search for weapons of mass destruction began, but none were found. \\nManipulate\\nFinally, the debate turned to whether intelligence reports had been manipulated to convince the American public that Iraq posed a clear and imminent threat to US national security. The media turned its focus back to Bush’s State of the Union speech, and to reports that the CIA had received information from an “unnamed former envoy” — Wilson — that Saddam Hussein’s alleged quest for Nigerian uranium was false. \\nNational Security Advisor Condeleeza Rice boldly asserted during a June interview on NBC’s Meet the Press that no high-level officials in her department could have known that the Niger allegations were fallacious.\\n\\n\\n\\nCondoleeza Rice’s assertion provoked Joseph Wilson\\n\\n\\n\\nCondoleeza Rice’s assertion provoked Joseph Wilson\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this point, Wilson decided to publicly disclose what he knew in a New York Times editorial, something that sank him neck deep into a political firestorm that damaged the Bush presidency.\\nWhy did he do it?\\n“I felt that it was important because of the confusion about it, and the fact that the story was spinning out of control,” Wilson said during a recent interview with Aljazeera. “I felt it was important I own the story by putting it down on paper, in my own words.”\\nFor Wilson, the administration’s refusal to acknowledge its own intelligence blunder left him no alternative but to speak out.\\n“The issue was how could somebody take so obviously unsubstantiated and unsubstantiable information and allow it to get into the president’s state of the union address?”\\nSpotlight\\nAll this has brought Wilson’s name into national spotlight. An ex-surfer from California, he spent 23 years in the US foreign service, most of that time in sub-Saharan Africa. Ironically, his first diplomatic assignment sent him to Niger in 1976. \\nHe was Senior Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council under former president Bill Clinton 1997-98. \\nFrom 1998-91, he served as the Deputy Chief of Mission to the US Embassy in Baghdad, where he personally met with Saddam Hussein four days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August of 1990. Today he runs an international business development firm in Washington. \\nAlthough he no longer works for the government, he still has great concerns about the use of US power throughout the world. America, he says, is in danger of following the so-called neoconservative domino theory of “illiberal imperialism as it relates to the Middle East.” \\n',\n",

If having the media report accurately is using them, then they were used,” said Col. David Perkins, who as commander of the 3rd Infantry Division’s 2nd Brigade had organised the tank foray into Baghdad specifically to garner publicity for the US advance. \\n“The main intent … was to get the story out,” he added. “I don’t know why anyone would want anything other than that.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was keenly aware that I was getting only one side of the story” \\nSteve Komarow,USA Today correspondent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis week’s conference at the US Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, about 190 km northwest of Washington, included combat officers and some of the journalists who travelled with them in a discussion of the Pentagon’s embed programme. \\nAll told, 527 journalists travelled into Iraq with Army, Marine and British ground forces during the six weeks of major combat operations that were declared over by President George Bush on 1 May. \\n‘Positive’ contributions\\nThe scheme drew a divided verdict from media critics who welcomed the coverage but worried about possible self-censorship among reporters dependent on the US military for their safety. \\nJournalists, who agreed to abide by a set of military ground rules, produced up to 6000 articles a week, including many that Army officers described as “positive” contributions to the military’s IO, or information operations, effort. \\n“If it was indeed an experiment, it was very successful from the standpoint of the military,” Army Lt. Gen. William Wallace, who was V Corps commander during major combat operations, told an audience of over 100 military officers and representatives from media outlets including Reuters. \\nReporters said the revelation that some military operations were designed to help achieve publicity aims was disturbing but not entirely unexpected. \\n“I was keenly aware that I was getting only one side of the story,” said Steve Komarow, a USA Today correspondent who was embedded with Wallace. \\nMany officers lamented the loss of embedded reporters since the news of the military campaign gave way to daily coverage of guerrilla attacks, political turmoil and crime. \\n“What we’re seeing now in Iraq is a loss of the IO campaign because we’ve lost the embeds,” complained Marine Col.

While re-enlistment levels among active duty service members are holding steady, the diminution of Army Reserve and Army National Guard volunteers could become a concern, Christman said. \\nThe Army counts on both the Guard and Reserve as a vital supplement to regular forces during extended military engagements, but the ongoing campaign in Iraq might dissuade people from enlisting or re-enlisting in either organization, he said.\\n“We’ll miss our National Guard enlistments and already we’re beginning to see the worst in signs of breakage of the pinnacle aspects of our Reserve component force,” he said.\\nAsking for help\\nAll this has left Bush administration scrambling to enlist the help of the international community, something it failed to do before the war, in the eyes of many diplomats. \\nThe State Department is preparing to submit a new draft resolution to the UN Security Council, asking other nations to contribute money and troops in exchange for a greater role in the reconstruction effort. \\nHowever, the US insists on retaining primary political and military control of the operation for the time being, something France and Germany have pointed to as a potential deal-breaker. \\nBoth sides have indicated that a compromise could be reached whereby the US would maintain command over all military forces and the UN would receive more involvement in the political decision-making in Iraq. \\nHalf million wanted\\nEither way, Dobbins said his vision of a 500,000 member security detail would require the international community to match the US troop level.\\n“It’s not unreasonable to think that the US can get the rest of the world to contribute a number of troops equal to the US number of troops,” he said.\\nInternationalizing the force structure is a key component in the fight to stabilize Iraq, he said. The consensus in Washington is that the current guerilla war is, he claims,\\xa0being waged by a small number of hardcore Baathists and possibly by foreign fighters with connections to al-Qaida. \\nWhile they probably will not\\xa0be deterred by an enlarged multinational force, the presence of more international troops might give the occupation greater legitimacy in the eyes of the Iraqi people, Dobbins said. Their assistance is what is needed to quell the resistance attacks, he said. \\n“The people you’re appealing to are not the extremists … If the general population feel that the US and its coalition partners are making them safer, then they will cooperate with the coalition forces,” he said.\\nIraqi police\\nMore cooperation means better intelligence, which equals a more effective crack down on guerilla fighters, he said. \\nBut the best way to provide security in Iraq is simple, experts say: let the Iraqis do it themselves. \\n“When the Iraqi capacity to provide security is bolstered, then the international community is served,” said Jeff Kojac, a fellow at the Center for Strategic International Studies who specializes in post-conflict reconstruction.\\nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld appears to agree, telling reporters recently that the creation of a larger Iraqi security force is one of his top priorities. \\nMore than 50,000 Iraqis are already serving as soldiers, police officers, border guards and paramilitary troops. Rumsfeld said he hoped to increase that number to 100,000 by next year.\\n',\n",

              "       'Yet many basic facts about the story are still murky – even to its protagonists. \\nIn testimony to the court on 1 September, Janice Kelly said she was never “quite aware” who her husband worked for. The British government denied on several occasions that David Kelly was working for their intelligence agencies. \\nHowever, a former MI6 officer, Richard Tomlinson, told Aljazeera.net, “David Kelly did have very close relations with the SIS (Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6 as it is popularly known). When he was working as a weapons inspector in the UN, SIS debriefed all the British weapons inspectors and considered it part of their duty to recruit them all.” \\nDisavowed agent\\nTomlinson was an SIS agent in Bosnia, Russia and the Middle East. \\nIn 1997, shortly after he was sacked, he was sentenced to a year in a maximum-security prison for illegally printing the names of SIS officers on a website, a charge he denies.\\nReports linked his fall from grace to a revelation that the Bosnian Serb war criminal, Radovan Karadzic, had made substantial donations to the British Conservative party. \\nToday, Tomlinson lives in France, unable to return due to the threat of arrest.\\n“Kelly obviously spent a lot of time working for the SIS,” he says. “Defence Intelligence Service people often get seconded and while their salaries are DIS or Ministry of Defence, they’re completely in the command structure of the SIS.” \\n“It’s fairly common that when people’s expertise becomes that specialised, they float around various departments. It gets very blurred at that level.” \\nBut if Kelly was floating between the intelligence agencies, could he have been pitching their ideas when he spoke to the BBC reporter Andrew Gilligan?\\n“That’s quite possible, yes,” Tomlinson agrees. “The SIS often use people like that. What will be interesting is if Lord Hutton demands to interview Kelly’s SIS case officer.” \\n“There’s no doubt that he would have been dealing with one person and that is who the Hutton inquiry should talk to. It would be a brave step, but I can see zero chance of it happening, given Lord Hutton’s background.”\\xa0Establishment voice\\nOn the legal circuit, Hutton is seen as an establishment voice likely to clear the intelligence services of any blame for Kelly’s death. \\nHe was one of the law lords who ruled that David Shayler, an MI5 officer accused of leaking state secrets to the press, should not be allowed to mount a public interest defence.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\nLord Hutton seen by some as too close to intelligence services\\n\\n\\n\\nLord Hutton seen by some as too close to intelligence services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe UK press was subsequently prevented from reporting his key allegation: that British security services had paid al-Qaida operatives to assassinate Colonel al-Qadhafi. \\nHutton was also involved in a decision to confiscate the proceeds from Tomlinson’s book, The Big Breach.\\n“Lord Hutton is a notorious sympathiser with the intelligence services,” Tomlinson says, with some restraint. “His inquiry is not as impartial as I would have liked it to have been.”\\nSuspicions that the intelligence agencies exercise undue influence over the courts inevitably feed suspicions that they exercise undue control over elected governments.\\xa0As Phillip Knightley, an author and expert on the British security services, puts it, “They see their allegiance as lying with the realm. One former intelligence officer said to me, ‘We owe our loyalty to the realm and not the government of the day. Government’s come and go, we go on forever’.”\\nWhen I put the quote to him, Tomlinson voice lights up with recognition. “That’s right,” he says. “That’s exactly what we were taught.”\\nPhillip Knightley, however, believes that this attitude is now shifting. “British intelligence is being changed irrevocably,” he says. “The change began in the US and where the CIA leads, other western intelligence agencies follow.” \\nIn fact, the “change” began in the weeks after 11 September 2001, when a powerful intelligence cell, the Office of Special Plans (OSP), was set up at the Pentagon under the tutelage of the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nINC led by Ahmad Chalabi gave western intelligence information\\n\\n\\n\\nINC led by Ahmad Chalabi gave western intelligence information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe OSP filtered material supporting war against Iraq to the White House, bypassing established State Department and CIA channels. \\nMuch of it came directly from the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an emigre body led by the convicted fraudster Ahmad Chalabi, who now sits on the Iraqi Governing Council. \\nThe reaction from staff at the CIA and MI6 was visceral. \\xa0Unreliable information\\nIn the run-up to war, a former CIA officer in the Middle East described a Washington Post story alleging links between Saddam and al-Qaida as “toilet paper”.\\n“I think they [the Bush administration] are desperate to make a case for war to the world,” he said. “I don’t believe this is coming from the CIA, it’s coming from the White House and the Pentagon. Unfortunately, their information is not good.”\\n“They’ve become dependent on the INC (Iraqi National Congress) because Iraq is such a black hole in terms of reliable information. People tend to pick up whatever information will serve their goals.”\\nThe question, I ventured, was how such information could be verified. “No,” he replied. “The question is whose information is now more reliable, the White House or Saddam’s?”\\nKnightley says that the CIA was thrown into convulsions when, post 11 September, Rumsfeld decided that it should be subject to the same scrutiny as other government departments. \\n“Two questions were at stake,” he says. “Should policy lead intelligence? And should the same people who gathered intelligence, assess it? Rumsfeld answered the first question yes, and the second question, no.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“If the current heads of British intelligence are reluctant to do what the government tells them, then they’ll find someone who will”\\nPhilip Knightley,author and security expert\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese answers, Knightley says, have now crossed the Atlantic. \\n“The Blair government believes that the British intelligence services are like any other department and it’s their duty, if requested, to provide information to help government policy.” \\nIn this case, that meant a dubious and unverifiable single-sourced, second hand quote about Iraqi WMD missiles being ready for launch in 45 minutes. \\nBut in Britain, moves to franchise out security service provision began in the 1990s, according to Richard Tomlinson.\\n“It was ridiculous,” he says. “They brought in management consultants who set targets for how many reports you had to produce and how many sources you had to recruit. It had a dramatic effect on the quality of our work, because the threshold of what was considered good intelligence was drastically lowered.”\\xa0“The battle is on,” Knightley adds. “The future of British intelligence for the next 50 years will be decided very soon.”\\nBattle of succession\\xa0If the Hutton Inquiry really is to determine the relative power of MI6 and elected government in the British state, a pointer to which side has won will come with the announcement of a successor to the outgoing head of MI6, Richard Dearlove. \\nDearlove has groomed his deputy as a replacement but the government is known to prefer the current chief of the Joint Intelligence Committee, John Scarlett, who loyally backed the official line about the Iraqi threat in the run-up to war.\\nKnightley suspects that “the Blair government will get their candidate in. If the current heads of British intelligence are reluctant to do what the government tells them, then they’ll find someone who will.” \\nHowever, Tomlinson, who worked under Scarlett in MI6’s Moscow office, gives him only a 20% chance of getting the job. “I think he’s probably been tainted by his association with Blair and Campbell now,” he says. \\n“He’s a bright and astute guy but also very harsh, a ‘hang the bastards’ type. There would be opposition from people in SIS who are unhappy with his public profile. I think his days are numbered.”\\n',\n",

The process does have a pollutant, in the form of CO2, which is a greenhouse gas, but the contribution to global warming would be far less than the equivalent emission using fossil fuel, says Lovley. \\n“In the short term, I see the usefulness would be for charging up batteries that can be used in a cell phone, something like that,” said Lovley. \\nThe technology could also be used in environments where it is difficult or costly to charge the batteries, he said, explaining that the US Department of Defence was interested in it for powering underwater microphones and sonar to spot passing ships and submarines. \\nAnd, for people living in poor, remote communities, it should be possible to adapt the electrodes so that they use carbohydrate waste from farm animals or sewage to power batteries for running fridges and stoves. \\n',\n",

Another 5,000 peacekeeping troops are stationed in Kabul under NATO command. \\nDaily attacks\\nOn his last visit to Afghanistan in May, Rumsfeld said the United States had moved from a period of major combat operations to one of stabilisation and reconstruction. \\nSince then, however, the Taliban have staged almost daily attacks against government posts, aid workers and US-led forces. Large parts of the south and the east of the country are off limits to foreign aid workers. \\nRumsfeld insisted security had improved each time he visited the country. \\nHe made no mention of Washington’s plans to increase aid to Afghanistan, which President George Bush is expected to announce soon. The Bush administration said in July it was preparing a $1 billion aid package for schools, roads and other projects. \\nThe United States spends $900 million a month on American military operations in Afghanistan and $900 million a year for economic assistance and training the Afghan national army.\\xa0\\xa0Tribal assembly postponed\\nMeanwhile President Hamid Karzai has postponed by two months a grand tribal assembly to approve a new Afghan constitution, which will pave the way for elections next year, his spokesman said on Sunday. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach province of Afghanistan will elect representatives to the loya jirga, with seats reserved for women, minorities and representatives of the millions of Afghan refugees still living in Pakistan and Iran. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“President Karzai today signed a decree to postpone the loya jirga to December,” spokesman Jawed Ludin told French news agency AFP. \\nHe said the decree was signed following advice from the Constitutional Commission. \\nAn agreement reached in Bonn after the 2001 ouster of the Taliban regime laid out the steps to mark Afghanistan’s progress towards democracy to culminate in elections in June 2004. \\nThe agreement allowed for the loya jirga to convene in December, but the United Nations proposed October instead, to which the Afghan government agreed. \\nUnread constitution\\nThe Constitutional Commission in charge of the process last month asked for more time to complete its work, which only began on 15 July.

              "       'This is an industry that has been likened by some experts to the Alaskan Gold Rush frenzy, a century ago. \\nThe half completed Park Avenue International\\xa0Apartment, one of China’s premier real estate\\xa0development sites,\\xa0is located in the\\xa0heart of Beijing. The going price is RMB 12,000/sqm ($1500) and it is already 70% sold.\\nAllen Kuo, a US-born Chinese, demonstrated his faith in China by recently buying an apartment in Shanghai as an investment. \\n“I needed some diversification away from the US markets. Although the real estate market is risky, so long as one has a diversified portfolio, Shanghai is a reasonable investment,” he said. \\nLike many other foreigners and Chinese alike,\\xa0Kuo sees a future in a country where year on year GDP growth of minimum 7% fuels rising house prices and sustains a burgeoning middle class keen to buy. \\nIn turn, property developers have responded to this latest aspect of “socialism with Chinese characteristics” by plowing money into real estate ventures. \\nInvestments mushroom\\nResidential property investment has grown by 30% annually over the last three years, sparking concerns that market supply is in a different league from market demand.\\xa0“In both the Beijing residential and commercial markets, there is an over supply of Grade A space,” said\\xa0Richard Lum, Deputy General Manager of property advisers Debenham Tie Leung. \\n\\n\\n\\nDevelopment at record pace\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelopment at record pace \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I would expect to see the Beijing market heading for a correction within a few years as new projects come online,” he said. \\nAs development continues at record pace in order to beat a 2006 deadline for the removal of cranes in time for the Olympics, results posted showed vacancy rates in Beijing had increased markedly during the first half of 2003. Grade A office and residential vacancies was at 17% and 26% respectively. \\nIn Shanghai, where the effect of SARS was less felt, rates were at 15% and 18%. Given that the first few months of 2003 saw a 37% increase in market investment compared with 2002, alarm bells have started ringing in government ministries. \\nFor the government, a strong real estate market has been one of the lynchpins of the new economy. Over a quarter of all bank loans, RMB1.8 trillion ($222bn) are tied to the property market, either through loans to investors or through mortgages. \\nWith outside analysts estimating 40-50% of all bank loans as being non-performing, unchecked market growth and subsequent collapse would have wide reaching implications.\\nThis monetary conundrum is a relic of the 90s when state banks were given free rein to lend money out in a system where paybacks and misappropriation are commonplace. \\nDebts \\nUntil recently, according to Li Da, a consultant with a major Hong Kong construction firm, it was possible for a developer to build with virtually zero capital. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Although the real estate market is risky, so long as one has a diversified portfolio, Shanghai is a reasonable investment.”\\nAllen Kuo, US-Chinese investor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“All a developer needed was some architect’s drawings and a wooden model. Prospective buyers, going for the cheapest purchase price, would pay deposits on a non-existent structure. Construction companies, desperate for the work would commit 20-30% of the total building cost hoping to reclaim it later and cash rich banks would chip in with the rest,” said Da. \\nThe result was that when financial difficulties take hold, the developer having no reserves of their own went belly up. \\n“There is not one construction company that is debt free,” explained Li Da, “and this is even after the government insisted all outstanding debts to construction companies should be paid.”\\nThe results of this behaviour speak for themselves. Abandoned building sites, although less common in Beijing and Shanghai, litter the landscape in second tier cities like Qingdao and Xining. With the current situation of high vacancy rates and decreasing rents, revenues and loan repayments are being squeezed.\\nState action \\nThe government, though, has seen the problem and is moving to adjust it. This month, the People’s Bank of China moved to increase the initial down payment paid by an individual buyer from 20 to 40% of total value thereby reducing mortgage costs on the banks. \\nMore crucially, they are set to increase interest rates payments for developers borrowing to finance high end projects as well as limit the amount developers can borrow.\\n“The government wants to ensure that developments in the pipeline are in line with what can be purchased by ‘healthy’ buyers who have the ability to repay and are buying for their own use or investment instead of speculating on property prices,” explained Michael Hart, Research Head at Jones Lang LaSalle Shanghai. \\n“By being explicit about higher down payment, the government effectively is controlling the pace of property development,” he said.\\nThe aim is to curtail spending on glitzy, high end projects and instead focus developers’ attention on the middle to lower market where there is currently great demand. By doing so, they stave off a banking crisis while addressing the social needs of China’s masses. It is a delicate balance. \\n“These are all small moves, if the banks squeeze too hard, they will choke everyone to death,” said Li Da.\\nComparisons with Japan of the early 1990s have been whispered, as a banking collapse there is still impacting on the country’s economic performance a decade on. \\nIt remains to be seen whether China’s banks can tip tow their way through this minefield as they wait for growing prosperity among local companies to account for the vacant space.\\n',\n",

Animals such as elephants also use infrasound to communicate over long distances, or as weapons to repel foes. \\n“So much has been said about infrasound – it’s been associated with just about everything from beam weapons to bad driving.

              "       'The discovery last month was a shocking example of China’s increasingly complex and highly lucrative trade in girls and young women. \\nFinal destinations for these unwitting victims may be the red light districts of China’s cities or the fleshpots of south-east Asia, but there is also a growing trend in the countryside to abduct women for marriage.\\nHuman trafficking has seen a revival in recent decades. Once labelled China’s oldest evil, it was though to have been wiped out during the Communist reforms of the 1950s. \\nBut fuelled by rural poverty and social breakdown, it has developed into a multi-faceted phenomenon involving thousands of people, mostly young girls, who are being duped and sold into prostitution, marriage and slave labour.\\nUnwitting victims\\nPolice say that over 10,000 cases a year are currently being reported, with one report estimating that in just four of China’s 23 provinces, 48,000 women were sold over a three year period. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Unemployment, poverty, low education and a lack of cultural awareness all contribute to being easily tricked into a situation where you have no control” \\nDavid Parker, UNICEF programme coordinator \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) believes this is only a fraction of the real number. \\nThe biggest problem, according to UNICEF, is\\xa0child prostitution. This usually involves cross border trade as girls are shipped into the tourist driven sex markets of south-east Asia. \\nPoor provincial girls who have travelled to larger Chinese cities looking for work are picked up by strangers, lured by promises of a high paid job or educational opportunities. \\nSometimes, however, it is people they know who sell them. In one case, a 27-year-old man was executed for selling his mother, wife, daughter and 18 other women.\\nTrapped\\n“Unemployment, poverty, low education and a lack of cultural awareness all contribute to being easily tricked into a situation where you have no control,” explains David Parker, senior programme coordinator of UNICEF in Beijing. \\n“Girls are sometimes transported immediately, sometimes there will be a delay or gradually progression through jobs until suddenly, they find themselves being sent to a bar or massage parlour in Thailand or Cambodia.”\\nOnce there, it is hard to escape. Often compelled to stay by so called “debts” that they owe their handlers, they have no legal papers, no local language skills and no idea of whom to turn to for help.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\nTurned into sex slaves, the youngwomen are sent far from home\\n\\n\\n\\nTurned into sex slaves, the youngwomen are sent far from home\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe non-government organisation Coalition Against Trafficking of Women claims that tens of thousands of Chinese women, mostly from the countryside, are to be found in Thailand alone, where they risk exposure to physical abuse and sexual disease.\\nMarriage trade\\nA further development has been the resurgence of the once common practice of “wife buying”. In rural China, the now expected dowries and wedding arrangements can easily exceed $2000, this in an area where salaries can be as little as several hundred dollars a year. \\nIn a symptom of a breakdown in social and legal constraints, the buying of a wife, typically in the range of $400-$800 is a considerably cheaper and increasingly common option for impoverished farmers or those with disabilities who would otherwise find it hard to attract a potential wife. \\nA 1997 UN report said that an investigation in one region revealed that between 30-90% of marriages were through trafficking and there were further reports of ‘markets’ in western China where women are displayed for purchasers.\\nForced marriage can often end up with women being miles from home completely at the mercy of their new family, frequently leading to beatings, rape and psychological torture. \\nOne recent documentary following self-styled private eye Zhu Wenguang saw him travel over a thousand miles to rescue one girl and return her to her family. \\nState clamps down\\nPreviously, the police ignored the issue, often giving an indulgent nod to the husband, but now they are taking a more serious stance. \\nIn 1991, the buying, as opposed to selling, of a wife was made illegal with life imprisonment or execution for those who buy girls under 14. \\nIn addition, a police report that in the early 1990s some 27,000 people were rescued.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn one UN report, 75% of rescued women refused to go back. The fear of social ostracism once they return home, particularly if they have borne a child is often too great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid Parker of UNICEF says, “The police are trying to break the boundary of their traditional role by helping and supporting these girls.” \\nThe issue does not stop with the police knocking down the door. In one UN report, 75% of rescued women refused to go back. The fear of social ostracism once they return home, particularly if they have borne a child is often too great. \\nTheir chances of remarriage are slim in a rural culture that prizes bridal chastity. \\nIn response, rehabilitation centres have been set up in recent years specifically aimed at women who are looking to rejoin society after years in a forced marriage or prostitution. \\nTrained to resist\\nLocal women’s groups are also placing emphasis on avoidance education, aiming to make girls wary of job offers that seem too good to be true. \\nAccording to Junko Mitani, assistant communications officer at UNICEF, “lots of women have heard about being conned but they really don’t know how to protect themselves”.\\nThe issue of baby trafficking as highlighted by the recent police discovery of the suitcase babies appears comparatively rare. The desire for a male child remains high in a society where daughters, once married, traditionally belong to the husband’s family. \\nThe constraints of the one child policy, although not always rigidly adhered to, apply added pressure amid reports of male babies changing hands for up to $3750.\\nBut even as authorities start to take action, the nature of trafficking is becoming increasingly complex. As the numbers of women migrating from country to town increase, organised criminals, enticed by high profit and low risk incentives, are turning trafficking into an industry.\\n',\n",

In fact thousands of wanted fighters have stayed, trained and moved through this area, leaving behind a human legacy.\\nA tribal elder in the adjacent Bajaur agency married off all three daughters to Arab fighters. One of them sits in an Afghan jail, the family says, and the other two have most probably been killed.\\n‘Immense benefit’\\nPakistan shares a 2200km border with Afghanistan, much of it in the North-Western Frontier Province alone, where up to 25,000 Pakistani soldiers are currently deployed to man the border and flush-out al-Qaida and Taliban fugitives in coordination with about 11,000 US troops based inside Afghanistan.\\n“The post 9/11 events and the hunt for anti-US radicals did make us cognisant of the need to attend to these remote areas,” said General Ali Muhammad Jan Aurakzai.\\n“These events have been of immense benefit, no doubt about it,” he added. \\nWith the deployment of troops, development of infrastructure has begun in a big way, explained Brigadier Zahir Shah, whose teams are cutting through hard rock to build roads for the 400,000 residents of the agency.\\nMeanwhile, people at Amankot are happy to see the drilling for water, which they said would free them of their dependency on the pond water that they shared with their sheep and goats. \\n',\n",

He denies the charge. \\nThe Israeli decision amounted to an ultimatum to the Palestinians to crack down on Islamic “militant” groups, as mandated under the road map, political analysts said. “It is more of a political threat, an ultimatum,” said Eli Karmon, an Israeli counter-terrorism expert. \\nIt also seemed intended to further isolate Arafat and signal to Quraya he must act independently and rein in “militant” groups. \\n',\n",

This was the first such incident in our city, but already everyone is wondering when the second or third attack will take place.” \\nNo fighting\\nArbil was liberated from Saddam Hussein’s regime during the Kurdish uprising in 1991, and since that time has been under the control of Massoud Barzani’s Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP).\\nThere was no fighting in this area during the US invasion which ousted Saddam Hussein and Arbil was spared from any of the post-war looting and violence which has gripped most of Iraq.\\nThe KDP Peshmerga militia and the Kurdistan police force, backed by a small number of US military personnel, have remained in firm control of the security situation in northern Iraq, until now.\\nHowever, in the aftermath of the Arbil blast, that is likely to change soon. The ethnic and religious divisions are widening and the possibility of full-scale civil war erupting increases daily.\\nDuring his whirlwind visit to Iraq last weekend, US Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld put a positive spin on American achievements to date and claimed to have witnessed an increase in “political pluralism” throughout the country.\\nGiven that there are over 120 political parties registered in Iraq since Saddam’s regime was removed, Rumsfeld ‘s comment is not without merit. However, the structure and composition of these various factions only serves to highlight the widening divide in Iraq – rather than any move toward collectivity.\\nMore alarming is that all of these new “democratic” political parties have their own armed security forces. “There are guys with guns everywhere here, and frankly, I don’t have a clue as to who the hell’s who,” said a visibly frustrated US Special Forces Staff Sergeant. \\n\\n\\n\\nRemains last week of a bombedUS humvee\\xa0 in Mosul used by the101st Air borne division\\n\\n\\n\\nRemains last week of a bombedUS humvee\\xa0 in Mosul used by the101st Air borne division\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe big NCO was guarding the police line at the Arbil bomb site, and he was trying to respond to reporters’ questions as to who was in control of the investigation.\\nWhile three US troopers tried to keep the media behind the taped off site, a cluster of armed Iraqis milled around behind them.

Should they be able to gain control of Kirkuk’s vast oil revenue, the concept of an independent State of Kurdistan becomes economically feasible.\\nAlthough officially the two Kurdish leaders – Massoud Barzani and Jallal Talibani – are co-operating with the US-sponsored Interim Council as part of a unified Iraq, the Kurdish separatist movement is very much alive in northern Iraq.\\nIncite\\nA sign at the border welcomes visitors to the “State of Iraqi Kurdistan” and all official buildings , Peshmerga guardhouses and even private homes fly the Kurdistan – rather than the Iraqi flag. \\nThe fact that after five months of occupation, the US military has yet to disarm the Kurdish Peshmerga, has concerned the other minority leaders. \\n\\xa0“We repeatedly warned the Americans not to start a war without properly preparing for its aftermath,” said Sanaan Ahmet Aga, the President of the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Americans have no choice but to admit that they have failed – and to turn responsibility for Iraq over to the UN”\\nSanaan Ahmet Aga, President of the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Turkey and the other neighbouring countries will never accept an independent Kurdistan – as it would incite their own Kurdish minorities to secede.”\\nIraqi Arab tribal leaders are also concerned with such a possible division in the north. Last week in a surprising development, the top tribal headsmen met in Ankara to discuss with government officials the possible deployment of Turkish troops into northern Iraq.\\n“This is not something which we desire – as it is setting the stage for a full-scale civil war,” said Sanaan Aga. “The Americans have no choice but to admit that they have failed – and to turn responsibility for Iraq over to the United Nations – before even more must suffer and die.” \\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

              "       'Local people\\xa0turn increasingly\\xa0to armed\\xa0men\\xa0to defend them from what they see as an occupying force. The military settles into a long war against “terrorism”.\\xa0 \\nSo far so familiar, but this is not a story about Basra or Fallujah. It is about a town called Derry in Northern Ireland, and a scandal that is emerging from Lord Saville’s inquiry into the killings of demonstrators there, 30 years ago.\\nIn\\xa0July, documents were disclosed indicating that the “terrorists on the demo” narrative, which the British army still defends, was the product of one Captain Michael Jackson.\\nAt the time, he was an adjutant to the First Battalion of Parachute Regiment. But today, General Jackson is the chief of staff of the British army, the highest military post in the land.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\nFamilies of the dead believe that Jackson and his commander, Colonel (then Major) Ted Loden, began the cover-up of a massacre in the hours immediately after Bloody Sunday. \\nCovering tracks\\n“I believe they set about trying to turn the tables when they realised what had happened,” says Michael McKinney, whose 27-year-old brother William died when he was shot in the back running away from the protest.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Willie never even lifted a stone during all the time that the rioting was going on in Derry”\\nMichael McKinney,brother of victim \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“They got the first strike out in the news to back up their soldiers.”\\nWhat this meant for the McKinney family was the blackening of William’s name. \\n“The paratroopers in that area said that they shot a number of nail bombers,” Michael says. “But Willie never even lifted a stone during all the time that the rioting was going on in Derry.”\\nWitnesses with immunity\\nMichael McKinney’s views are widely shared. \\n“People in the nationalist community are sceptical and even cynical about the prospect that the truth will out,” says the Sinn Fein education minister, Martin McGuinness. \\n“Don’t forget, this is an inquiry where the witnesses have been offered public immunity certificates, where the rifles have been destroyed, where thousands of photographs have not been offered and where documents have been withheld. It sounds like a cover-up to me. It will be very interesting to hear Lord Saville’s view.”\\nBut Lord Saville has kept his cards close to his chest. Observers believe he is walking a tightrope between\\xa0an absurd\\xa0military case and the power of the Ministry of Defence.\\n“The most difficult thing,” Michael says, “is that the soldiers were granted anonymity and immunity from prosecution so they would not be hostile witnesses. But they are just coming here and telling lies.”\\nUncertainty\\nSome are not telling anything at all. On a sticky afternoon in Westminster Central Hall, Soldier 037 is sweating as he gives evidence. He sports Parachute Regiment tattoos under his open-necked shirt and he speaks slowly and earthily.\\nHe played a small part on Bloody Sunday. But in the widely-criticised 1972 Widgery inquiry, 037 gave a statement to the Royal Military Police (RMP) that he had seen a demonstrator killed by an IRA man, shooting from the Rossville Flats. Today he is less sure. \\n“I think the RMP just wrote it and we just agreed to sign it,” is his first line of defence. But within minutes he cannot recall signing any document at all. \\nThe barrister becomes exasperated. “Isn’t it the case that the RMP were asking you to find an innocent explanation for Soldier U’s shooting?”\\n“That is not my recollection,” 037 mumbles. \\n“What is your recollection?” \\n“I don’t remember.”\\nKey document\\nBut despite\\xa0the\\xa0witnesses’\\xa0shortcomings, the tribunal has led to the disclosure of two key documents. The first was a list based on a debriefing of soldiers that Loden said he had conducted on the day. \\nLike so much evidence in the inquiry, Loden’s original notes have disappeared from the Ministry of Defence (MoD). But what remains is a set of grid reference points and coordinates for 15 “engagements” in which unnamed soldiers supposedly defended themselves from attacks by nail bombers and gunmen.\\nMichael Mansfield QC described the list as an attempt to fabricate evidence justifying the killing of innocents. Certainly, no soldier has recalled Loden’s alleged debriefing; perhaps with good reason. \\nInconsistency\\nIt was inconsistent with the actual locations of the dead – none of whom were nail bombers or gunmen. It posited shots passing through buildings to reach their targets, non-existent barricades and spectre-like gunmen appearing in two places at once. \\nIt was leaked to the press in the hours after Bloody Sunday, and set the tone of coverage for years to come. Under the more rigorous examination of the tribunal, however, Loden found himself in trouble by his third day on the stand.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\nLord Saville’s inquiry has enjoyedlittle publicity\\n\\n\\n\\nLord Saville’s inquiry has enjoyedlittle publicity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the fourth came a bombshell. Without warning, a fresh manuscript of operations emerged from the MoD. Loden described it as mysterious, inexplicable and nothing to do with him. \\nIt was handwritten, he agreed, by Michael Jackson, and it tallied precisely with his list. Inevitably, some inferred that Jackson was putting his name on the line in a attepmt to bail Loden out. \\nMI5 allegations\\nNow, as the tribunal prepares to move back to Derry for its final session this autumn, the stakes could hardly be higher. The city is after all, the site of the killings in 1972 and a centre of nationalist opposition to the British army. \\nMcGuinness, for one, continues to believe that in 1972, the troops were sent in “to teach the people of Derry a lesson.” Such a view may be more consistent with Republican mythology than the evidence emerging from Saville’s inquiry.\\xa0 \\nSome republicans fear MI5 allegations that McGuinness fired shots at British troops on Bloody Sunday will be used to divert attention from the disarray of the military’s case. \\nMcGuinness, though, is dispassionate. “As someone who is going to testify before the inquiry, I always anticipate dirty tricks,” he shrugs. “Every trick in the book is going to be used to try and justify the soldiers’ actions on that day.”\\n“There has been an attempt by elements in the British military to turn the Bloody Sunday tribunal into the Martin McGuinness tribunal, but I don’t think they’re going to succeed.”\\nSceptical\\nPerhaps, but the inquiry has come a long way from the optimism that greeted its launch in 1998. Then, Tony Blair sounded almost idealistic when he told Parliament: “I believe it is in everyone’s interests that the truth be established and told. That is also the way forward to the necessary reconciliation.” \\nMichael McKinney still agrees, but with the weariness of a marathon campaigner. “But there were 13 deaths on that day and a further 14 people were shot. Someone must be brought to account for what happened.”\\nSome are more downbeat. \\n“I don’t anticipate truth and reconciliation coming out of this tribunal,” McGuinness says. “That’s what I would like to see but until the inquiry gives its verdict I’ll be as sceptical as the rest.”\\n',\n",

The Bedouin village of Kseifeh is the poorest community in Israel.\\xa0The problems facing Bedouins, indeed the rest of the Arab community in Israel, have their roots in the\\xa0supremacist nature of the Jewish state.\\xa0There are two laws granting citizenship in Israel: one for Jews called the law of return and\\xa0a second for non-Jews.\\xa0\\xa0Jews\\xa0are granted automatic citizenship once they arrive in Israel and prove their Jewish identity.\\xa0Non-Jews are given the same\\xa0citizenship but\\xa0it is no guarantee for equality under the law since nationality – not citizenship – is the chief criteria determining state policies.\\xa0Even if\\xa0this inferior citizenship is granted, non-Jews\\xa0live as lesser citizens and\\xa0are “tolerated permanent residents.”\\xa0“They (Israel) don’t and won’t consider us equal citizens for the simple reason that we are not Jewish.

The new figures will pressure President George Bush to try harder to share the burden of occupying Iraq with other nations. \\nEarly attempts\\xa0to round up troops and money from traditional and recent allies hit the rocks when Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, rejected a French proposal as ‘totally unrealistic’. \\nNew casualties\\nFour US soldiers have been killed over the past week, bringing the number of combat dead since major military operations in Iraq were declared officially over on 1 May to 69. A similar number have died in accidents. \\nIt is estimated that about 10 soldiers are wounded every day the occupation continues.\\nBut they have remained largely hidden, as it is military policy to announce that a soldier has been injured only if they were hurt in an incident that also involved a death. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Pentagon claims that the reason the numbers are so high is that the modern body armour, worn by most American soldiers, means that normally fatal wounds are avoided. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCritics of the policy say it hides the true extent of the casualties. According to the website lunaville.org, that compiles its numbers from official reports, 1178 American soldiers have been wounded in combat operations since the war began on 20 March. \\nThe real number may be much higher, once you factor in the reported 313 who were hurt in “friendly fire” incidents or accidents, then those unreported thousands who have suffered lasting physical or mental health problems from their long tours of duty in Iraq.\\nSome American units, such as the Fourth Infantry Division, have been on the frontline for over six months. \\nBody armour\\nThe Pentagon claims that the reason the numbers are so high is that the modern body armour, worn by most American soldiers, means that normally fatal wounds are avoided. However, vulnerable arms and legs are affected badly. This has boosted the proportion of maimed among the injured. \\nDealing with the aftermath of amputations and bomb blast injuries is common. Mines, home-made bombs and rocket-propelled grenades are the weapons of choice of the Iraqi resistance fighters. They cause the sort of wounds that will cost a soldier a limb.\\nThe wounded return to the USA with little publicity, the Washington Post reports. Giant C-17 transport jets on medical evacuation missions land at Andrews Air Force Base, outside Washington, every night. \\n“Our nation doesn’t know that,” said Susan Brewer, president and founder of America’s Heroes of Freedom, a nonprofit organisation that collects clothing and other personal items for the returning troops, to the Washington Post. “Sort of out of sight and out of mind.” \\nBattlefield casualties are first treated at Army field hospitals in Iraq then sent to Landstuhl Regional Medical Centre in Germany, where they are stabilised for the flight back home. \\nThen Andrews is the first stop back in the States. The wounded walk or are stretchered into a fleet of ambulances and buses that waits at the C-17s most nights to take off the most seriously wounded. \\nThose requiring urgent operations and amputations are ferried to America’s two best military hospitals, the Walter Reed Army Medical Centre, near Washington, and the National Naval Medical Centre, Bethesda. \\nAnother website, www.iraqbodycount.org, has calculated from media reports that the\\xa0 number of Iraqi civilians to have been killed in the conflict is between 6125 and 7843, with over 20,000 injured.\\n',\n",

              "       '\\nBut one person who won’t be worrying is Billy Hayes, the leader of the Communications Workers Union, who may soon be leading a challenge to the government’s union policy. \\n\\xa0\\n“Only slaves don’t have the right to withdraw their labour,” he says. “It’s a fundamental human right to desist and stop working in protest.” \\n\\xa0\\nPostal workers\\n\\xa0\\nOn 17 September, the postal workers Hayes represents\\xa0will finish\\xa0their first ballot for a nationwide strike in several years. He is upbeat about the prospects. \\n\\xa0\\n“We’re confident that our members will give us a mandate,” he says. \\n\\xa0\\n“We’ve had years and years free of strikes in this industry and we still haven’t seen a breakthrough in postal workers’ pay. Nobody welcomes strikes, but they are a useful weapon and we’d be fools not to use an effective weapon in our armoury.”\\n\\xa0\\nThere are two issues at stake in the dispute in the Union’s dispute with Royal Mail. \\n\\xa0\\nThe first is a substantial pay claim for postal workers, who the union says exist on less than £200 a week. The second is an estimated 30,000 planned redundancies. \\n\\xa0\\nSolidarity action\\n\\xa0\\nThere is also, arguably, a third: the need for the government to knock the Hutton Inquiry, which reconvenes this week, off the newspaper front pages.\\n\\xa0\\nHayes sighs when\\xa0asked\\xa0if he’s prepared for a battle with Whitehall. \\n\\xa0\\n“We don’t see this as a confrontation with the government, but at the end of the day, the government is the shareholder and the shareholder must take an interest in the disruption of their services.” \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nobody welcomes strikes, but they are a useful weapon and we’d be fools not to use an effective weapon”\\nBilly Hayes,Communications Workers Union\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“If they don’t, they will be held to account.”\\n\\xa0\\nHayes says that this disruption will be limited to ongoing one and two day walk-outs, at least initially, but could it also involve a challenge to the government’s laws banning solidarity action? \\n\\xa0\\n“I think the government is not at a high point of popularity and trying to take on the postal workers would be a mistake,” Hayes answers, a little cryptically. \\n\\xa0\\nProactive\\n\\xa0\\nThe CWU is not alone in taking a more proactive position towards collective bargaining. \\n\\xa0\\nIn union after union, the last few years have seen election slates swept by a ‘new wave’ of young union leaders – or an ‘awkward squad’ of militants, depending on your perspective. \\n\\xa0\\nThere is Andy Gilchrist, who led the firefighters dispute earlier this year, Mark Serwotka of the civil servants union PCS and Bob Crow, the bogeyman of British tabloid newspapers, who now runs the train drivers union, the RMT. \\n\\xa0\\nAll are young and highly professional. All are on the political left.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDear: We are intent on not doingdeals that sell our membersinterests short\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What defines us,” says Jeremy Dear, president of the National Union of Journalists, “is that we have grown up as activists and we are intent on not doing deals that sell our members interests short.” \\n\\xa0\\n“The ‘partnership approach’ and the experience of this Labour government have been very disappointing for our members. So we are reclaiming our unions for a much more strident policy.”\\n\\xa0\\nGenerational shift\\n\\xa0\\nThe reasons for the new mood of militancy among British trades-unionists are many and varied. Dear believes it is primarily because, “We work in the most profitable industries in Europe and yet we suffer from the fewest rights, lowest pay and longest hours.”\\n\\xa0\\nThis is true – but has also been the case for many years. Billy Hayes sees the phenomenon as more of a generational shift. \\n\\xa0\\n“Some of those who go on strike now wouldn’t know about the Winter of Discontent 24 years ago,” he says.\\xa0 “There is a growing mood, but I wouldn’t overstate it. We’re still at historically low levels of industrial action.” \\n\\xa0\\n“The increase in action is coming from a very low base and it has a lot to do with tightness in the labour market. Low unemployment makes people feel that their bargaining position has improved.”\\n\\xa0\\nHawks among the trades union movement might shiver at the other side of the coin that Hayes’ is alluding to: the recession inflicted on the British economy under the first Thatcher government in 1981, to reduce, in a general sense, workers’ living standards.\\n\\xa0\\nBosses flourish\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDigby Jones represents Britishemployers\\n\\n\\n\\nDigby Jones represents Britishemployers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing could have been further from the lips of Digby Jones, the general secretary of the Confederation of British Industry, when he addressed the Trades Union Congress in Brighton on\\xa09 September. \\n\\xa0\\n“The reputation of the UK as the investment location of choice is due to several factors,” he said, noting “the macro-economic stability delivered by this government, low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment and sustainable growth.” \\n\\xa0\\nIn a conciliatory flourish, Jones, whose organisation represents British employers added that it was “also partly due to modern trade unionism. My members don’t want that to change.”\\n\\xa0\\nNo spokespeople for the CBI – or the Royal Mail – were available for comment when contacted by Aljazeera.net. But it is a fair bet that the “modern unionism” Digby Jones praised, was not that of the aforementioned new wave. \\n\\xa0\\nIraq\\n\\xa0\\nOne aspect of the new unionism Jones might be particularly happy to see changed is the historically unprecedented opposition to a foreign war that has swept the union movement\\n\\xa0\\nDear summarises the mood thus: “Here is a country that can spend millions of pounds on the invasion and occupation of Iraq and yet can’t find money for public services or education at home. A lot of people will challenge that because they thought the war was immoral and illegal to start with.”\\n\\xa0\\nIn a worrying twist for the government, Dear pinpoints another unintended consequence of the Baghdad fallout.\\n\\xa0\\n“In the light of the Hutton Inquiry, we are also less likely to trust the word of the government when they try to calm us on pensions or workers rights,” he says. “The issue of trust will feed into disputes in the public services as well.”\\n\\xa0\\nThe government should be worried. While keeping wisely savvy on the NUJ’s reaction to any specific request for solidarity from the CWU, Dear says it will be his members “natural reaction” to support the postal workers in any dispute. \\n\\xa0\\nAnd he hopes that they do.\\n',\n",

His father opened the door after they lobbed a bomb at the house. \\nArmed and covered in blood, the militants surveyed the terrified family. \\n“One man said to the others, ‘You haven’t shot them yet? This is how you shoot’, and he started shooting,” said Mahir in the steady tone of someone who has re-visited this memory many times. \\nFrom his hiding place in the bathroom, Mahir saw his family being executed. Amid screams, the militiamen murdered his father; Bassam, 13; Farid, six; Shady, four and Shadya, one and a half. \\xa0“Shadya was trying to crawl towards me. She was looking at me and screaming and saying, ‘dada’. When they saw her still moving, they shot her in the head. I saw her brains blown out,” he said in a dead voice. She slumped over between her dead father and mother, who had been injured, but not killed. \\n“I wanted to help her – and he (militiaman) killed her. And I couldn’t do anything,” he said after a pause. “I won’t forget that feeling.” \\nResponse \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA day after multinational forces evacuated Beirut, Sharon claimed “2000 terrorists” were still in the camps. He sent an order to the Israeli command saying the “mopping up” would be carried out by the Phalange. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe exact number of victims will never be known. The International Committee for the Red Cross initially counted 1500 bodies at the time, but by 22 September this count had risen to 2400. The next day, another 350 corpses were uncovered, raising the total to 2750.\\xa0 \\nHowever, this toll does not include those still unaccounted for, buried in mass graves or carted away by militiamen, never to be seen again. \\nOn 16 December 1982, the UN General Assembly condemned the massacre and declared it to be an “act of genocide”.\\xa0 \\nAnd in 1983, a three-member Israeli commission of inquiry, charged with investigating the massacre known as the Kahan Commission, found Sharon along with other Israelis, personally responsible for the massacre. \\nSharon resigned as defence minister, only to become prime minister in 2001, sending a shudder throughout the Arab, and the\\xa0world.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nOpen wounds\\n\\nMahir’s sister Suad was seriously injured in the legs, making it impossible for her to escape after the militiamen had left their home. \\n\\nMahir, his brother Ismail who had taken refuge with him, left with their mother,\\xa0believing they could find her an ambulance. \\nFor three days, she laid among the quickly rotting corpses of her family. She was raped at least once during that period by militiamen.\\n\\n\\n\\nImages the Palestinians will nevererase\\xa0from their history\\n\\n\\n\\nImages the Palestinians will nevererase\\xa0from their history\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuad is one of 23 survivors bringing a case against Sharon in Belgium, under the country’s law of universal jurisdiction for acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. \\nUnder the 1993 law, Belgian courts could try suspects for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, regardless of where the alleged incidents took place or the accused’s nationality. \\nBut under intense US and Israeli pressure, the law has been amended so that now a Belgian prosecutor will have to decide which cases fall under the law’s jurisdiction. \\nIsrael’s prime minister, responsible for what has been described as “among the most heinous crimes of the 20th century” has never been punished. \\nMahir, however, believes his sister’s efforts are futile because “she has no power and money and the world is power and money.”\\xa0 \\nHe then falls into a short silence, contemplating the thousands who were butchered.\\xa0“Sometimes I feel like talking about this.

              "       'That is the hope among what opinion polls suggest is now a clear majority of the island’s Turkish Cypriots. The irony is that many of them would prefer to continue as part of a state formed jointly with Greek Cypriots than stay separate – or become a de facto province of Turkey.\\n“There has been a massive change in Turkish Cypriots’ mindsets in recent times,” says Muhmmad Ali Talat, the leader of the main Turkish Cypriot opposition party, the centre-left Republican Turkish Party (CTP). “Everyone is concentrating on the prospects for solving the Cyprus problem, and who can achieve this.”\\nTalat and other opposition leaders hope that the coming December elections to the Turkish Cypriot parliament will sweep them to power – ousting the administration of long time leader Rauf Denktas.\\nDivided island\\nSince 1974, when a coup inspired by the then-military junta in Athens led to an attempt by nationalist Greeks to unite the island with Greece – sparking the Turkish military occupation of the northern third of the island – Cyprus has been divided. \\nThe southern Greek Cypriot-dominated Republic of Cyprus remains the internationally recognized government of the whole island. Meanwhile, in the north, the Turkish Cypriot dominated territory under Turkish military occupation announced it was forming its own state in 1983. \\nDenktas was the first and only president of this Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). To date, only Turkey has recognized this state, though it does have an observer status with the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).\\nSince then, a string of UN sponsored efforts to reunite the island have always come to nothing. \\nNew way out\\nAt the end of last year, a new plan, labelled the Annan Plan, after UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, was proposed.\\xa0\\nThe plan\\xa0gives the two historically antagonistic communities on the island a great deal of autonomy, while establishing a rotating leadership and a series of checks and balances in the island’s central government. It also guarantees the continued presence of Turkish and Greek troops on the island to give each community security.\\n\\n\\n\\nBig Brother: Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have to grant Cyprus\\xa0more autonomy\\n\\n\\n\\nBig Brother: Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have to grant Cyprus\\xa0more autonomy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe plan was ignored by Denktas who described it as “a great threat to civilisation”. \\n“The Annan plan is what Turkish Cypriots have wanted all along,” says Ozdil Nami, the chairman of the Turkish Cypriot Businessmen’s Association. “It’s a balanced idea, for the first time talking about a Turkish Cypriot state within the state of Cyprus.”\\nThis gives the Turkish Cypriots the recognition they had long felt denied – that they are an essential part of the island’s make-up.\\n“Denktas is out of touch with the Turkish Cypriot people,” says Talat. His party’s polls put opposition to Denktas – and support for the Annan plan – at about 70% of the Turkish Cypriot population.\\nThese figures also reflect what many observers on the island are saying. “Nowadays, everyone supports the plan,” says leading journalist and commentator Husayn Alkan. “Even those who were opposed to it a few months ago are totally in favour now.”\\nBridge to Brussels\\nOn 4 September, Talat signed an agreement with two other opposition party leaders that should they win at the December polls, they would ditch Denktas and agree to the Annan plan. They are in a hurry to do so because pressure for change is so great – and because on 1 May 2004, the Republic of Cyprus joins the European Union, with or without them. \\nMany Turkish Cypriots see this as a train they cannot afford to miss. If a deal can be done, they can enter the EU too, perhaps years ahead of the Turkish mainland, which also has EU aspirations.\\nTurkey has long been the islanders’ Big Brother, backing Denktas and keeping the TRNC closely in its orbit. Until recently, it had planned to retaliate against Cyprus’ EU entry by annexing the north and turning it into a Turkish province. \\nWith the election last November of the Justice and Development Party government of Prime Minister Recip Tayyip Erodgan in Turkey, much has changed. \\nErdogan has made it clear that Ankara is now willing to agree to the reunification of the island – provided that this helps Turkey’s own application for EU membership. In turn, the EU has also made Ankara’s help in finding a solution a condition for beginning accession negotiations.\\nHowever, back on the island, behind the clamouring for an end to isolation and for the inking of the UN – and then EU agreements – many Turkish Cypriots still have reservations about what reunification might mean in practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There are disadvantages to reunification, but the disadvantages to staying apart are far greater. And so are the dangers”Ozdil Nami,chairman of the Turkish Cypriot Businessmen’s Association\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince April this year, the frontier between north and south has been opened to Greek and Turkish Cypriots, who have taken the opportunity in their thousands to visit their long forbidden neighbours. It has also been a chance for some to return to the villages and homes of their birth – which many had not seen since 1974.\\n“It was a very emotional time,” recalls Alkan. “People were weeping at the sight of their old homes.” \\nHowever, as time went on, for some, uneasiness began to emerge.\\n“The Greek Cypriots look down on us,” says Muhammad Cakici, a hotel owner in Girne, formerly known by its Greek name of Kyrenia. “They see us as second class – as poor people. They are very arrogant.”\\nMany other Turkish Cypriots have expressed similar reservations. “I get many complaints of this,” confesses Talat. “The Greek Cypriot officials are the real problem. They have to change their attitude too.”\\nEconomic gulf\\nThere are also economic concerns. The Greek Cypriot south is on the verge of EU membership, with average annual incomes five times those of the Turkish Cypriot north. Before 1974, 95% of businesses with more than five employees were Greek Cypriot owned. Since then, few Turkish Cypriot businesses have grown any bigger. \\n“Wages are much lower in the north,” adds Alkan. “Now, Turkish Cypriots are being employed by Greek Cypriots in the south as cheap labour. They earn less than Greek Cypriots for the same work.”\\n“Technically speaking,” adds Nami, “we’re not ready at all for EU membership.” The legal framework is not in place, and the TRNC is far from meeting other vital EU criteria on economic and political development.\\nDespite this, most Turkish Cypriots remain convinced that reunification, via the Annan plan and leading to EU membership, is not only vital, but imminent.\\n“There are disadvantages to reunification,” says Nami, “but the disadvantages to staying apart are far greater. And so are the dangers.”\\nFew need reminding of that in the island’s capital, Nicosia, where a line of bullet riddled buildings and barricades make this one of the world’s last divided cities.\\n“In a few months,” says car rental manger Serkan Cin, looking out at this barbed wire entangled border, “all this will be finished.”\\nIt is a hope that many Turkish Cypriots share – even if the future that lies beyond the barricades still holds many doubts.\\n',\n",
              "       '\\nRoughly, 6.1% of the workforce is unemployed and jobs are still disappearing every month, but economic growth is beginning to pick up. So far, though, the increased productivity is yet to translate into a decline in unemployment.\\n\\xa0\\nNearly three million Americans have lost their jobs since President George Bush took office in January 2001. Economists who were predicting a large budgetary surplus just three years ago, are now projecting a massive $480 billion deficit for 2004. That is the bad news.\\n\\xa0\\nThe good news, economists say, is that productivity levels are rising and the increase in the unemployment rate appears to be slowing down. While the worst may be over, no one knows what to expect in the near future.\\n\\xa0\\nWage levels down\\n\\xa0\\n“Even though GDP (gross national product) is actually growing, things have been worsening in terms of less jobs and lower wages,” said Lawrence Mishel, a financial expert at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank. \\n\\xa0\\nMishel said a study by his organisation showed that, on average, US wage levels were down by about 1%.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\xa0US\\xa0spends roughly $1billion\\xa0a week on the occupation of Iraq\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\xa0US\\xa0spends roughly $1billion\\xa0a week on the occupation of Iraq\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor jobs to be created, GDP would have to grow by about 4% in order to make room for all the new workers in the country, and for redundant workers looking to find another job, according to Barry Bosworth, a senior economist at the Brookings Institution, a DC-based think tank. \\n\\xa0\\n“We have to grow faster just to stand still in terms of jobs,” Bosworth said.\\n\\xa0\\nRight now, the economy is growing at roughly 3.1%, but probably\\xa0there will not be any significant improvement in the job market until businesses are confident the growth will continue, something Bosworth said might not happen.\\n\\xa0\\n“I think the decline in employment will stop, but I agree with people who worry that the growth will not sustain into next year,” he said.\\n\\xa0\\nUnemployment is a source of great concern for the Bush administration, heading into next year’s presidential campaign. The administration pushed a $350 billion tax cut through Congress three months ago with a promise that the plan would create new jobs, something that has not happened, said Mishel.\\n\\xa0\\n“The president claimed that he was going to be able to create 340,000 jobs a month with the tax cut,” he said. “So far, that hasn’t materialised and I don’t think it’s going to.”\\n\\xa0\\nConservatives argue that the unemployment rate would be much worse without the small boost in economic growth that they say was generated by the tax cut. However, if the employment level continues to fall, Bush could be in trouble next year, say experts.\\n\\xa0\\nBigger concern\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhile jobs are clearly a source of concern in Washington, the most heated debate is centred on the rising federal deficit. \\n\\xa0\\nWhat was once expected to be $5.6 trillion government surplus by 2011, is now anticipated to be a $2.3 trillion deficit by the same year, according to the Congressional budget office. \\n\\xa0\\nDemocrats are worried that a large deficit could lead to spending cuts in education and other social programmes.\\n\\xa0\\nThey also wonder how the administration will be able to pay for any of the new programmes it is proposing, such as expanded Medicare coverage and billions of dollars to help fight AIDS in Africa, without having to borrow the money and increase the deficit to nightmare proportions.\\n\\xa0\\nDeficit spending has always been controversial in American politics, and the current cost of the US-led occupation of Iraq is a shining example of that. \\n\\xa0\\nThe US is spending roughly $1 billion a week to sustain the occupation, and the international community appears reluctant to share the economic burden without political concessions the Bush administration is unwilling to grant. \\n\\xa0\\nBush recently announced a request for $87 billion from Congress in order to pay for the military and reconstruction effort in Iraq and Afghanistan next year.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Social Security will have to become far less generous…Medicaid will no longer provide basic medical care to the poor” \\nPaul Krugman,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Economist\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany economists believe deficit spending during a war can help the economy by spurring productivity.\\n\\xa0\\n“In the short term deficits can have a positive effect on the economy by increasing expenditures, by increasing demand,” Mishel said.\\n\\xa0\\nHowever, over the long term, a mounting deficit could lead to an economic disaster, pushing interest rates sky high, making it extremely difficult for both the government and private businesses to obtain bank loans, he said.\\n\\xa0\\n“There’s going to be a backlash from businesses and from Wall Street at some point over the deficit,” he said.\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, debate continues over the viability of the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts,G pushed through by President Bush so far, which many liberal economists say bears much of the responsibility for the size of the projected deficit.\\n\\xa0\\nIf the economy remains relatively stagnant, the increased military spending and tax cuts could threaten spending levels on important federal programmes, according to a recent article in the New York Times Magazine by economist Paul Krugman.\\n\\xa0\\n“Social Security will have to become far less generous; Medicare will no longer be able to guarantee comprehensive medical care to older Americans; Medicaid will no longer provide basic medical care to the poor,” Krugman said.\\n\\xa0\\nMost political experts agree that it is still too early to tell whether the economy will present a real threat to President Bush in the 2004 election. But Mishel said that if things did not improve by next spring, Bush could have a problem.\\n',\n",

              "       'Hajj Muhammad Salim Dudin says he has spent a third of his life travelling between Israeli prisons to visit his four sons. \\n“I know all the jails in Israel by heart. I visited all of them,” said the 68-year-old farmer with a sigh.\\nHajj Muhammad’s household\\xa0is\\xa0a symbol of the\\xa0suffering Palestinian families whose relatives are political prisoners in Israeli jails. \\nHe lives in a modest three-room house in the hamlet of al-Alaka al-Fouka, about 32km southwest of the occupied West Bank city of\\xa0Hebron. Despite the\\xa0hamlet’s remoteness, it has not escaped the\\xa0brutality\\xa0of Israeli occupation. \\nHajj Muhammad’s trials\\xa0first began shortly after midnight on 28 December 1980, when crack Israeli soldiers stormed his home to arrest his eldest son, Yasir, on suspicion of belonging to Fatah, President Yasir Arafat’s group. \\nYasir, 42, is married and a father of five children. He was in and out of Israeli\\xa0prisons\\xa0for much of 1980-1993. \\nSince his first detention in 1980, the family has become a constant target of Israeli reprisals, raids and arbitrary arrests. \\nThe 1993 Oslo peace accords with Israel did not end the family’s plight since the village, like the bulk of the Palestinian countryside, remained under Israeli control. \\nHajj Muhammad recalls one incident in 1997 when he says Israeli soldiers tried to murder his other son, Khalid.\\n“They came to arrest him, but I suspected that they actually wanted to kill him and then claim he tried to escape. So, I handed him over to the commanding officer, after which the soldiers ganged up on him like mad dogs. How would you feel watching your child being beaten mercilessly before your eyes and you can’t do anything to help him?”\\nBehind bars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUS-backed peace\\xa0“road map” hasdone little to end suffering\\n\\n\\n\\nUS-backed peace\\xa0“road map” hasdone little to end suffering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSoon thereafter, the Israeli army arrested Hajj Muhammad’s remaining sons: Ayad, 27, Khalid 18, and Musa, 22, on grounds of having ties with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, or involvement in anti-occupation attacks.\\n“The army came around midnight, pounding and cursing. They dragged them from their sleep, handcuffed and blindfolded them and then struck them on the head,” he said. \\nThe Israeli authorities imprisoned the four brothers in separate jails, hundreds of kilometres apart.\\nAyad, a staff nurse working for the Red Crescent Society, was sent to al-Fara camp near Tulkaram. Khalid, now a school teacher, was sent to a desert camp known as Ketziot near the Egyptian border while Musa was sent to the notorious Ramleh prison. \\nMusa\\xa0was then subjected to intense psychological and physical torture for 240 consecutive days.\\xa0\\nFighting fronts\\xa0With his four sons behind bars, Hajj Muhammad took to the road, commuting between the offices of the Red Cross to inquire about the whereabouts of his sons and offices of “those greedy lawyers who are only interested in grabbing money from the poor families of the prisoners”.\\xa0“Coping with this pain and overwhelming daily suffering became a way of life,” the Hajj said.\\xa0The financial burden began taking its toll as he planned for costly weekly visits, organized by the Red Cross and Red Crescent society. \\xa0Ayad and Yasir’s children would “break my heart by constantly asking ‘where is dad, and when will he come home?’ ” \\n“It is like fighting on 10 fronts at the same time, where you either have a nervous breakdown or do what you can until God brings about a breakthrough,” said Hajj Muhammad. \\nDespair \\nHe admits to\\xa0sometimes giving in to despair.\\xa0 \\xa0Israeli prison officers could be brutal, he said, recalling an incident in Hebron during a visit to Musa, who is serving a\\xa0life sentence for attacking an Israeli army vehicle and killing a soldier.\\n“The prison officers told me to wait 30 minutes. When Musa didn’t show up, I began to have suspicions. I asked the officer again if Musa was there and he asked me to wait five more minutes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“How would you feel watching your child being beaten mercilessly before your eyes and you can’t do anything to help him?”\\nHajj Muhammad, a\\xa0father of four\\xa0Palestinian detainees\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then a secret service agent asked me my name. He grabbed me by my neck and dragged me for a hundred metres on the ground,” he said, adding he was “mortally humiliated”. He fainted and later regained conscious in the hospital. \\nComing from a society which places high value on personal dignity, this incident was a severe blow to his pride.\\nResistance from prison\\xa0\\nThen, there are the hardships endured because of his children’s own struggles. \\nIn the last three months, Musa has gone on two hunger strikes in protest at being shackled and placed in open-ended solitary confinement. The first strike lasted for 32 days, during which Hajj Muhammad fretted even more about his son’s health. \\nEarlier this month, Hajj Muhammad received a call Musa was dead after going without food for 22 days, and water for three days. \\nThe news turned out to be inaccurate. After pressure from the Red Cross and human rights groups, Musa was transferred to a prison hospital where he recuperated. \\n\\n\\n\\nMusa is serving a life sentence\\n\\n\\n\\nMusa is serving a life sentence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe prison authorities also promised to end their inhumane\\xa0treatment.

              "       'Abrahams is the founder of the Ig Nobel Prize. Like the Nobel Prize, which laud the world’s brightest minds for writing top-notch literature or making the world a better place through scientific achievements, the Ig Nobels are awarded once a year.\\nBut the similarities stop here. \\nSince 1991 Abrahams has been handing out Ig Nobel-prizes awarded to people whose achievements “cannot or should not be reproduced”. \\nAmong the first winners was former US Vice President Dan Quayle, who took the education award for, “demonstrating, better than anyone, the need for science education”. \\nAmong the gaffes that won Quayle his Ig were: “It isn’t pollution that’s harming the environment. It’s the impurities in our air and water that are doing it” and, “Space is almost infinite. As a matter of fact, we think it is infinite.” \\nNow, after more than a decade of honouring triumphs of persistence over probability, Abrahams has compiled a new book, The Ig Nobel Prize: The Annals of Improbable Research. \\nThe book offers insight into some of the most bizarre research ever presented with a straight face. \\nClassic research \\nOne research recalled is a paper penned by three Scottish doctors entitled The Collapse of Toilets in Glasgow. After three patients, within six months, showed up in their emergency room with injuries sustained while sitting on lavatories, the intrepid doctors decided to investigate.\\n“An obvious way of using a toilet without fear of collapse is…not to sit down, but to adopt a hovering stance,” advised the groundbreaking 1993 paper. \\nFor Abrahams, the key thing to becoming an Ig Nobel winner is to have produced something where, “the only reaction that is at all reasonable is that it makes you laugh and you think about it afterwards”.\\n\\n\\n\\nDan Quayle was corrected by 12-year-old on spelling of potato\\n\\n\\n\\nDan Quayle was corrected by 12-year-old on spelling of potato\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbrahams sifts through 5000 ideas nominated by scientists and members of the public for the 10 Igs awarded yearly. \\nBut Abrahams does not spend his days mulling over issues like how best to dunk a cookie in a cup of coffee. When he started studying applied mathematics at Harvard University, his ambitions were to set up a software company.\\nWhen the company failed to set the world alight, he began editing The Journal of Irreproducible Results before starting up his own magazine and devoting his life’s work to the decidedly peculiar.\\nNose picking fun \\nAmong the items highlighted in Abrahams’ new book is an academic treatise conducted by Indian scientists, working at a government institute, on adolescent nose picking. \\nThe 2001 report found that nose picking is the same across social classes. About 80% of teenagers do it exclusively with their fingers, while the rest are split almost evenly between using tweezers and pencils. \\nDelving deeper, the doctors found about 50% of people pick to unclog their noses, 11% do it for cosmetic reasons, while a similar number does it just for fun. \\nFinally, the equally groundbreaking 1995 study Tumbling Toast, Murphy’s Law and the Fundamental Constants concluded: “Toast falling off the breakfast table lands butter-side down because the universe is made that way.”\\xa0 \\n',\n",

The killers were eventually pardoned by a Presidential decree. \\n\\xa0\\nThe bloodiest attack by Gush Emunim on the Palestinians was carried out by Goldstein in 1994 during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, when Muslims were praying at dawn at the Ibrahimi Mosque in downtown Hebron. \\n\\xa0\\nWhile Israeli officials publicly condemned the carnage, Gush Emunim leaders, including Marzel, Noam Federman, and others,\\xa0openly praised the criminal act, hailing Goldstein a\\xa0“saint who carried out the Lord’s will”. \\n\\xa0\\nIn fact, the settlers went as far as erecting a shrine in honour of\\xa0the attacker\\xa0in Kiryat Araba, which became a pilgrimage attraction for extremist Jews from around the world. \\n\\xa0\\nHowever, as these and other crimes failed to make the Palestinians leave, Gush Emunim leaders began to openly advocate the idea of “transfer” or expulsion of the Palestinians from the territories. \\n\\xa0\\nSome Gush Emunim leaders equivocate and prevaricate when confronted with the issue of transfer, especially when talking to a non-Jewish audience or the media.\\n\\xa0\\nSupremacy\\n\\xa0\\nFor example, Israeli National Religious Party leader Eifi Eitam wrote recently that Palestinians “who choose to stay in the land of Israel\\xa0will have to recognise the supremacy of the Jews in this land”.\\n\\xa0\\nThe same idea was voiced by Rabbi Yesheyahu Magnes, from Mirkaz Ha’arv, Gush Emunim’s theological headquarters. \\n\\xa0\\n“If the Arabs want to stay, they will have to come to terms with the fact that they live in a Jewish state.” \\n\\xa0\\nWhen asked if he would support giving the Palestinians and non-Jews in general “equal political and civil rights”, Magnes evaded the question.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“God gave us this land and we have no right to give any of it away” \\nRabbi Baruch Marzel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is no country in the world where a minority enjoys absolute equal political and civil rights,” he said. \\n\\xa0\\nHowever, when reminded that an American Jew, Sen Joseph Leiberman, was nearly elected as Vice-President of\\xa0 the US a few years ago, the rabbi retorted that “it was because he was Jewish that he lost.” \\n\\xa0\\nMagnes would not\\xa0spell out the implications entailed in non-Jews accepting to live under Jewish rule. \\n\\xa0\\nHowever, according to Halacha, or Jewish rule, a gentile permitted to reside in the Land of Israel “must accept to pay a tax and suffer the humiliation of servitude” and that such a gentile “be held down and not raise his head against Jews.”\\xa0 \\n\\xa0\\nIn the final analysis, however, Gush Emunim rejects as a matter of principle the presence of the Palestinians west of the River Jordan, on no other account than their being “goyem” or non-Jews. \\n',\n",

A charismatic and highly articulate speaker, his London-based website Arab Media Watch is part of the\\xa0wave clearing a way for this new Arab lobby.\\n“The older generation came here from the Middle East and I guess they weren’t used to being able to express their feelings without a sense of fear,” he says. \\n“I know a lot of them are afraid of going out on demonstrations in case they’re filmed. There is a paranoia, which is understandable.”\\n“But this younger generation has been born and brought up in Britain. They feel British. They don’t have Arabic accents. They’re not afraid of speaking out and they’re very eloquent.” \\nPalestine\\xa0The Muslim Association of Britain’s demonstration in support of the Intifada in the spring of 2002 was a key turning point in the trajectory of this new generation. Up to 100,000 people marched in the largest pro-Palestinian protest London had ever seen. \\n“Growing up as a kid during the first Intifada, I got upset when I saw people being shot,” Sharif says. “Then when my parents told me I was a Palestinian, I felt very angry that they’d kept it from me for so long.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\xa0study by the Glasgow University Media Group study found that the vast majority of BBC news consumers did not know if Palestinians were occupying Israel or vice versa\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToday, Sharif is still trying to expose facts and information hidden from sight. His professional and constantly updated website, Arab Media Watch, brings together hundreds of activists – mainly Muslims, but also Christians and Jews – to monitor media reports and take action. \\nAlerts over biased stories are sent out, along with a call for people to write or telephone news executives to register their protests. They have been kept busy since the beginning of the Intifada. \\nIgnorance\\nA\\xa0recent study by the Glasgow University Media Group study found that the vast majority of BBC news consumers did not know if Palestinians were occupying Israel or vice versa. \\nIt also found that they did not even know whether settlers in the occupied territories were Israeli or Palestinian.\\nIsraeli lobbyists of course would dispute such research. Shulie Davidovitch, the press secretary of the Israeli embassy in London believes the British media is biased against Israel and she is in no doubt as to the reason why.\\n“The Muslim community in this country constitutes a huge and very powerful lobby,” she says. \\n“There’s no comparison between the numbers of Jews and Muslims living here, or between the influence of the many Arab countries – with all their oil wealth – and tiny Israel, which is always blamed for everything.”\\nFlattered\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA fifth of all fatal shootings byIsraeli forces kill children, themajority are shot in the head\\n\\n\\n\\nA fifth of all fatal shootings byIsraeli forces kill children, themajority are shot in the head\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSharif, however, smiles at such estimations of his group’s strength. “I’m flattered,” he says, “and they are right to be scared. It shows we are giving them a run for their money. But our potential has not nearly been reached. Our main pitfall is a lack of funding.” \\n“The pro-Israel lobby is not as powerful as people feel. There are more Muslims here, but they haven’t all been mobilised yet. It is happening though and eventually we will get the upper hand because this is a just cause.” \\n“People understand that occupation, settlements, house demolitions and colonisation are a universal wrong whether they’re carried out against Palestinians, Chechens or Aborigines.”\\xa0Biased reports\\xa0Certainly, Sharif claims many successes in forcing media groups to change inaccurate or prejudicial phrases and language in reports. \\n“They rarely ever say that the settlements are illegal and they always get the number of settlers wrong,” he says for starters.\\nBut currently, AMW is honing its campaign on use of the term ‘security fence’ to describe the wall being built in the West Bank. \\n“It’s more than a fence,” Sharif says, his eyes widening with passion. “It’s a huge wall with dugouts and everything. To call it a security fence without quotation marks implicitly accepts the Israeli justification for it – that it’s about security.” \\nApartheid\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurity fence\\xa0is an\\xa0apartheid wall \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPalestinians argue the structure should be called “the apartheid wall” because it annexes their territory, seizes resources, splits up families and imprisons an entire people behind Israeli watchtowers.\\nSharif shows me an email AMW has just received from BBC News Online in response to a letter of protest sent by an activist. “We feel we are right to use the term ‘security fence’,” the letter begins, “as this is what Israel is calling it.”\\nArab Media Watch is not alone in complaining about such attitudes. From the Muslim Public Affairs Committee to the Friends of al-Aqsa, there are now many lobby groups springing up around the country.\\xa0 \\nThey are also increasingly effective, as the row over an episode of the BBC drama Spooks, featuring a brainwashed Muslim “suicide bomber” wandering around a schoolyard, demonstrated.\\xa0Pressing the right buttons\\nHowever, according to one senior source at The Guardian newspaper, the pro-Israel lobby is still highly influential in setting the tone of many major Middle Eastern news stories. “The Palestinians and Arabs try to do the same,” she says, “but they’re in a completely different position.” \\n“They write to people who do sympathetic pieces saying ‘thanks very much, you must be under a lot of pressure’, whereas the pro-Israel groups focus aggressively on issues like what words we put in headlines, which pictures are used, how suicide bombings are reported. They know which buttons to press from a journalistic sensitivity.”\\nThe new Arab lobby in Britain is trying to pick up on exactly these journalistic issues. It has clearly come a long way in a very short time.\\n',\n",

But five months after the war no chemical or biological weapons have been found in Iraq. \\nCampbell and Hoon are also likely to be asked about the government’s handling of Kelly after he admitted to his bosses that he may have been the source of an explosive BBC report in May accusing Blair’s government of “sexing up” the dossier. \\nHoon, singled out by British media as a likely government fall guy over the Kelly affair, has played down his role in the strategy to name the scientist. \\nBut the inquiry has shown that he attended a meeting where officials at his ministry agreed to confirm Kelly was the suspected BBC source if his name was put to them by journalists. \\nHe also overruled advice from his top civil servant to shield Kelly from a hostile parliamentary grilling just days before he took his life. Lawyers for Kelly’s family have their first chance to quiz Hoon over both issues on Monday. \\nSpokesman back in dock\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlastair Campbell: Out of work but still under suspicion\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAlastair Campbell: Out of work but still under suspicion\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCampbell, who told the inquiry last month he had “no input, output (or) influence” on the inclusion of the 45-minute claim into the dossier, may be asked why he asked senior intelligence officer John Scarlett to harden up the assertion. \\nScarlett himself returns for cross-examination at the inquiry on Tuesday, along with Blair’s official spokesmen. \\nThe BBC, which stood by its report in public despite private doubts over “flawed reporting”, will be in the dock on Wednesday when Chairman Gavyn Davies is questioned. \\nCounsel to Hutton’s inquiry James Dingemans will deliver a closing statement on Thursday.

Its leader in Gaza, Muhammad al-Hindi, confirmed that his group “will not participate” in the government but welcomed the opportunity to hold talks with Quraya. \\nQuraya also earlier met with local members of Fatah and was also expected to hold talks with local members of the Palestinian parliament in the evening. \\nAhmad Heles, secretary of the Fatah High Committee in Gaza, said that the movement would give Quraya its full support. \\n“We listened to his point of view and we support all the proposals,” he said. \\nIncursions\\nIn further violence on the ground, the Israeli army imposed a curfew in Jenin after tanks, jeeps and armoured vehicles re-entered the centre of the West Bank town, Palestinian and Israeli security sources said. \\nThe sound of gunfire could be heard, but there were no reports of any casualties.

The agency supplied most of the photographs in the book, which was made\\xa0available to Reuters news agency\\xa0ahead\\xa0of its October publication. \\n“In Islam, as in many other religions, anyone can call himself a religious leader,” he said in the book. “So, besides paying mullahs, the CIA created fake mullahs – recruited agents who would proclaim themselves clerics and take a more moderate position about nonbelievers.” \\n“We are taking over radio stations and supporting clerics,” a CIA source was quoted as saying. “It’s back to propaganda.

In fact, the hot air balloon flight would have to wait for cooling of the political hot air between the two countries. \\nIf the hard-hitting statements of the leaders of India and Pakistan against one another –\\xa0being made in and outside their respective countries –\\xa0are any indication, the two sides are once again at loggerheads. \\nPakistan has accused India and Israel of “state terrorism” that could justify Muslims engaging in guerrilla warfare against them. “State terrorism targets people seeking freedom from foreign occupation, as in Palestine and Kashmir,” Pakistani President Musharraf said on Monday. \\nSirrioHe told a daylong conference of world leaders in New York that there should be no selective application of the international norms and standards against terrorism. \\nIndia came down heavily on what it termed as Islamabad’s “Kashmir itch” and accused Pakistan of vitiating the positive atmosphere created by New Delhi’s initiative to extend a “hand of friendship” to Islamabad. \\nPakistani leadership, said an Indian foreign office spokesperson, would do well to “fast” for some time before embarking on their “annual pilgrimage” to the UN. \\nSparring between India and Pakistan has become an annual feature on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session and the war of words is expected to heat up further after President Musharraf delivers his address to the UN on Wednesday. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will\\xa0address the session the next day. And when Kashmir is burning, each side will\\xa0find it easy to castigate the other before the world community.\\nKashmir is burning again\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\nThe blood of both Islamic militants and the Indian security forces seems to be up again in the disputed Himalayan region that has been the bone of contention between the two countries. \\nThe region is witnessing one of the largest upsurges in violence since a separatist drive began in the state 14 years ago, with militants and soldiers fighting half a dozen gun battles each day. \\nEven by the standards of Kashmir, where security personnel or militants are killed almost everyday, the state is seeing more violent activity than before. \\nAlthough the officials continue to blame “foreign mercenaries” crossing over from Pakistan for the upsurge in violence, there are indications that Kashmir may be set to witness an increase in local youths joining the militant groups.\\nThe killing of nearly three hundred people in the upsurge in violence over the\\xa0past three weeks has forced the hardliners in both India and Pakistan to harden their stances. \\nKashmir has seen rivers of blood before, but the two countries remained in a tentative rapprochement. This created the hope that the peace will not be evading the people of Kashmir for long. \\nSurge of violence reinforces anger\\nBut Kashmir observers say the surge of violence has reinforced anger in Delhi and Islamabad, which always denies the charge that it is behind the trouble in the state.\\xa0 \\nIf the killing in the 30 August counter-insurgency operation of Ghazi Baba –\\xa0the commander of Jaish-e-Muhammad accused of being the mastermind of last year’s terror attack on the\\xa0Indian Parliament and a similar strike against the state assembly secretariat in Srinagar, the two incidents that had left nearly fifty people dead – was seen as a major breakthrough by the Indian security forces against the militants, the former too were at the receiving end.\\xa0The worse for India came when a former fighter who broke ranks and joined Indian security forces to combat separatists in Kashmir was killed\\xa0on 13\\xa0September, in an attack on his motorcade in hometown Hajjan. In the sneak attack on Muhammad Yusuf alias Kuka Parray, five of his associates were also killed and several others were wounded. \\nIn his death, the Indian Army lost one of its most trusted men in Kashmir who had turned the tide as he changed sides when the violent campaign for independence had virtually collapsed the Indian authority over the state. \\nIndia’s Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani saw in his death a “great loss” to India and the pro-Indian forces in Kashmir. Advani said that the recent spurt of terrorist violence in the country appeared part of a “bigger game plan” of the militants and would be countered. “This has been going on… there is no one small aim. We have to fight it out,” he said.\\xa0The killing came merely two weeks after one of Parray’s close former associates Javed Hussain Shah was shot dead by militants in the Kashmiri capital, the killing that coincided with Prime Minister Vajpayee’s visit to Srinagar to inaugurate the chief ministers’ conference. \\nThe visit during which Vajpayee was expected to announce a political package in an effort to win over the separatist and other disgruntled political parties was also marred by a two day strike in Valley. Before flying back to New Delhi, he admitted that normalcy has not returned to Jammu and Kashmir.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0If the killing of Ghazi Baba encouraged the Indian security forces to hunt for other key players of the violence struggle for independence, the murder of Parray and Shah made them astringent enough to go in for reprisals. They claimed killing more than ninety militants, mostly Islamic fighters from outside India called foreign mercenaries by them. \\nBut in some of these cases, the residents disputed their claims. They took to the roads to protest against\\xa0“gruesome killings” of the local youth in fake encounters after having been detained on charge of being militants. Kashmir’s police chief Gopal Sharma does not agree. “All those killed were either terrorists eliminated by us in encounters or civilians who were either caught in crossfire or targeted by the terrorists.” \\xa0Is Pakistan behind the violence?\\xa0No one is sure why there has been an upsurge in violence. One of the several theories in circulation in Kashmir suggests that since India seems to be reluctant to talk to Pakistan on Kashmir, Islamabad must have thought why not to do something in order to bring it to its knees. \\nSome also do talk about President Musharraf’s own problems back home particularly the rise of the Islamic hardliners who want him to step down. “If Kashmir is burning, he can silence his critics by pleading that in the national interest this is not the right time to disturb him,” says political commentator Tahir Mohiuddin.\\xa0\\xa0What is also possible is that he may have no control at all over the Jihadi outfits like the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad, known to be mainly involved in the violence in Kashmir. But the fact that indigenous Kashmir group Hezb-ul-Mujahedin too has become active again places a question mark before such an observation. \\nTahir feels that by encouraging more and more Kashmiri youth to cross the de facto border to receive arms training, Pakistan, as well as Jihadi groups perhaps, wants to dispel the Indian claim that it is now mainly “foreign mercenaries” who are creating trouble in Kashmir. \\nNeither wants to give diplomatic edge to India, which will loose the argument if those killed or captured back in Kashmir turn out to be locals. It is also an open secret now that vicious circles are not interested in peace returning to Kashmir. \\nThey strive on both sides. Again, no one can deny the fact the war between various agencies is taking its toll in Kashmir. \\xa0Hurriyat splits\\xa0New Delhi’s covert endeavour to win over Kashmir’s main alliance of separatist parties Hurriyat Conference suffered a set back as it tore apart earlier this month. \\nThe buzzing word taking round in Kashmir’s political circles before the split, was that the alliance’s top leadership barring a former chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani and some others were eager to begin talks with it to arrive at a settlement. \\nBut the hardliners led by Geelani preempted the move by causing a split in the conglomerate. He has since taken over as the chairman of the parallel Hurriyat Conference.\\xa0\\xa0Rebels accused the leadership of “deviating” from the Hurriyat Conference agenda and “betraying” the cause of the Kashmiri nation. Reacting to the charge Shia cleric, politician Moulvi Abbas Ansari said, ”What the enemy could not achieve all these years has been done by our own people,” implying that Geelani has weakened the conglomerate, which had emerged as a force to reckon with. But Abbas contracted himself when he claimed that Hurriyat Conference “is intact.”\\xa0Apparently conscious of the damage inflicted on their credibility by Geelani and supporting outfits, Prof Gani asserts that unless New Delhi acknowledges the people of Kashmir being the principal party to the dispute, no talks could be held with it to find an amicable solution. “We’ll take the struggle to its logical conclusion come what may,” he vowed. \\nThe people have not liked the split in the alliance but blamed\\xa0the leadership for it. Journalist and political commentator Imdad Husayn seems to be in agreement. He says, “If Geelani has out staged moderates in the Hurriyat Conference it is not him who should be censured for causing the split. \\nAbbas, Umar and Prof Gani acted recklessly when they began making statements that would clash with the local sensitivities.” \\xa0Dialogue process is scuttled\\nKashmir watchers say that to capture the Hurriyat Conference than opting for new political party is a calculated move. The Hurriyat Conference is the brand name that still sells within and outside Kashmir and it would have been foolish on part of the hawks within the separatist echelons to suddenly plunk it. \\nAlso, it is now an open secret that Pakistan supports the Hurriyat Conference’s stance on Kashmir or vise versa and has, in fact, worked hard to introduce conglomerate to the outside world as the “true representative body of the Kashmiri people.” \\nNobody at home and abroad would have accepted the logic behind the swing of supporting a new party and suddenly starting speaking ill of the Hurriyat Conference nurtured all these years. \\nHence came the move to takeover the conglomerate. \\nMore importantly, the process of dialogue with the Indian government is likely to be scuttled as Geelani is deadly against any such move unless Pakistan too is involved or, at least, the proposed talks between the two countries are monitored by a third neutral country. \\nOn the other hand, the Abbas faction of the Hurriyat Conference seems to be on a\\xa0defensive rather than\\xa0on a damage control exercise to dispel the impression that it was now more close to New Delhi than Islamabad and willing to have a bilateral dialogue with the former.\\n',\n",

This time next year, if there are none left to farm, the farmers will have no option but to leave – and they will have nowhere to go.” \\nSuch humanitarian concerns have prompted thousands of young activists to literally put their lives on the line in support of the Palestinian cause.

But Rachel says that activists do not need to risk their lives to be effective: “Bearing witness has been a key part of our work from the very beginning.” \\nInterestingly, calls for a new approach to a final settlement are increasing in London’s activist circles at the same time as the security situation in the Middle East is\\xa0deteriorating. \\xa0A new movement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout 200 activists will risk theirlives in West Bank, Gaza Strip\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout 200 activists will risk theirlives in West Bank, Gaza Strip\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a recent conference in the School of Oriental and African Studies, about 80% of speakers reportedly called for a one state solution to the Palestinian question.\\xa0 \\n“We need to rethink our strategy,” says Mortaza Sahibzada, a respected ISM veteran. “There has to be a big change in the way we campaign in the future.” \\n“The expulsion (of Arafat) will be a clear indication that Israel won’t allow any form of Palestinian autonomy, or even leadership. We need to move towards winning human rights – and the vote – for Palestinians within a unified state.”\\xa0 \\nMortaza’s argument – that a two state solution is no longer viable because of the facts on the ground, created by Israel in the West Bank – is gaining currency in dissident Jewish circles too.\\xa0 \\nA recent speaking tour by the Israeli ‘new historian’ Ilan Pappe galvanised London activists with calls for a new global civil rights movement to unite dissident Jews and Muslims around demands for a joint right of return and franchise.\\nAfter all, they say, it is easier for Zionists to win sympathy for a fight against terrorism than against democracy. \\nIn the meantime though, this year’s olive harvest will again take place in the shadow of the gun and activists will continue making the leap from Pimlico to Jericho.\\n',\n",

It is not known whether Arad is still alive. \\nThe lawsuit comes after an Israeli court ordered the defence ministry to investigate a claim by Dirani that a large sum of money was taken from him when he was kidnapped in 1994 by the Israeli army to be used as a bargaining chip. \\nTiming questioned\\nBut Dirani’s lawyer, Zvi Rish, accused Arad’s family of “abusing the legal system” with the sole purpose of scuppering the exchange deal, which still has to be officially approved by the cabinet. \\n“The timing is obvious.

Total foreign ownership would have been allowed “in all sectors except natural resources.” \\nControversial package\\nForeign banks would have got the green light to enter Iraq, with a total of six foreign banks allowed to buy up to 100% of local banks within the next five years. \\nThe package announced in Dubai caused an immediate storm in Iraq, where businessmen and analysts expressed fears that outsiders could swallow up the national economy.\\xa0“The measures which have been announced will lead to foreign domination over economic decision-making and largely sign away the independence” of Iraq, said Ridha al-Qureishi, a financial and monetary expert and academic. \\nThe new confusion over the US-installed administration’s economic policy came as it was seeking to assert itself on the international as well as domestic front. \\nKilani and other economic officials were at the IMF, Oil Minister Ibrahim Bahr al-Ulum was attending OPEC talks in Vienna and council president Ahmad Chalabi was in New York for a key UN debate on Iraq’s future.\\n',\n",

He had suffered from leukaemia at least since the early 1990s. \\nKnown for his groundbreaking research in the literary field and his incisive political commentary and music criticism, Said was one of the United States’ most prominent intellectuals. \\nHis writing regularly appeared in the Guardian of London, Le Monde Diplomatique and the Arab-language daily al-Hayat.\\nThrough his writing and his speeches, the Palestinian Christian academic became a leading voice in the struggle of his countrymen for self-determination.\\xa0\\xa0A life in exile\\nHe was born in 1935 in Jerusalem – then part of British-ruled Palestine – but Said spent almost all his adult life in the United States.\\nIn 1948, he and his family were dispossessed from Palestine and settled in Cairo. \\nSaid first came to the United States as a student. He received a bachelor’s degree from Princeton in 1957 and a master’s and PhD from Harvard, in 1960 and 1964 respectively.\\n\\nMost of his academic career was spent as a professor at Columbia University in New York, but he also was a visiting professor at such leading institutions as Yale, Harvard and Johns Hopkins.\\n\\nDue to his advocacy for Palestinian self-determination and his membership of the Palestine National Council, Said was not allowed to visit Palestine until\\xa0recently.\\nHis writing, translated into 14 languages, includes 10 books, among them, Orientalism (1978), a runner-up in criticism for the National Book Critics Circle Award; The World, the Text and the Critic (1983); Blaming the Victims (1988) and Cultural Imperialism (1993). His most recent book, Peace and Its Discontents: Essays on Palestine in the Middle East Peace Process, was published in 1995.\\nA thrower of rocks\\nSaid was consistently critical of Israel for what he regarded as mistreatment of the Palestinians.\\nHe prompted a controversy in 2000 when he threw a rock toward an Israeli guardhouse on the Lebanese border.\\nColumbia University did not censure him, saying that the stone was directed at no one, no law was broken and that his actions were protected by principles of academic freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have been moved to defend the refugees’ plight precisely because I did not suffer and therefore feel obligated to relieve the sufferings of my people”\\nEdward Said\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe wrote two years ago after visits to Jerusalem and the West Bank that Israel’s “efforts toward exclusivity and xenophobia toward the Arabs” had actually strengthened Palestinian determination.\\n“Palestine and Palestinians remain, despite Israel’s concerted efforts from the beginning either to get rid of them or to circumscribe them so much as to make them ineffective,” Said wrote in the English-language Al-Ahram Weekly, published in Cairo.\\nCritic of Arafat\\nAfter the signing of the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, Said also criticized Yasir Arafat because he believed the PLO leader had made a bad deal for the Palestinians.\\nHe said in a lecture at Tufts University that Arafat and the Palestinian Authority “have become willing collaborators with the (Israeli) military occupation, a sort of Vichy government for Palestinians.”\\nHe lived to see a musical partnership with Argentina-born Jewish pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim bear fruit. The West-Eastern Divan orchestra of young Arab and Israeli musicians played an ecstatically received concert in Rabat, Morocco last month, the 80-piece ensemble’s first date in an Arab country. \\nBarenboim and Said, who founded the orchestra together, said at the time they hoped the concerts would help to bring friendship, peace and security between Palestinians and Israelis.\\nNot a refugee\\nIsraeli scholar Justus Reid Weiner published an article in the American magazine Commentary accusing Said of dramatising his own background to enhance his credentials as a spokesman for the Palestinians. Weiner said Said claimed he was driven out of Palestine while actually his family was living in the Egyptian capital Cairo before the founding of Israel.\\nSaid replied by saying he had never described himself personally as a refugee. He said he had always maintained he spent much of his youth in Egypt and Lebanon, but that many of relatives were dislodged from Palestine as Israel came into being.\\nHe wrote in the Egyptian Al-Ahram Weekly, “I have been moved to defend the refugees’ plight precisely because I did not suffer and therefore feel obligated to relieve the sufferings of my people.”\\n',\n",

We may not have been able to stop the war in Iraq but we dealt a serious blow to Tony Blair.”\\nCertainly, Blair’s ‘honest kind of a guy’ image that once worked so strongly in his favour, now appears to be a liability, particularly among the media-savvy young. \\n“Tony Blair just goes along with everything that George Bush says,” complained Jasmine, a 20-year-old from Manchester. \\n“Everyone I know back home wants him to resign. I’d like Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats, to replace him, but only because he’s the best of a bad bunch.” \\nBush protest\\nWhatever manoeuvres are launched against Blair within the Labour party next week, the Stop the War Coalition is hoping that the mood of discontent peaks during a three-day visit to London by President Bush in November.\\xa0 \\n“This protest is the beginning of a campaign for a demonstration against Bush’s visit that will be really huge,” John Rees said. \\nThe political seismologists in Number 10 may well be put on alert.

The\\xa0plants are instructed to administer beatings in the cells for the purpose of extracting information from inmates.\\n\\xa0\\nRecruitment\\n\\xa0\\nThe Shin Beth, Israel’s domestic intelligence apparatus, uses a variety of tactics to recruit collaborators.\\n\\xa0\\nRecruitment often begins with an innocuous summons to the local Shin Beth officer who would evaluate the\\xa0prospective agent’s “vulnerability” and “susceptibility” and accordingly decide whether to pursue or quit the attempt.\\n\\xa0\\nIn many cases, the Shin Beth officer would use blackmail to recruit collaborators even in the face of initial\\xa0stiff resistance.\\n\\xa0\\nSometimes the Shin Beth would force a given person into a dilemma situation whereby he or she would have to choose between the lesser of two evils.\\n\\xa0\\nThere are numerous instances where the Israeli Civil Administration refused to grant a Palestinian father a travel permit to transfer his\\xa0sick child to hospital in West Jerusalem unless he agreed to work for the Shin Beth.\\n\\xa0\\nDuring the first Intifada (1987-1992), the Shin Beth used “sexual blackmail” to recruit informers. \\n\\xa0\\nIn this case, a certain person,\\xa0usually respected in the community,\\xa0would be videotaped while in\\xa0a compromising manner with a prostitute who is often a Shin Beth agent. \\n\\xa0\\nThe Shin Beth would then use this information to blackmail the\\xa0victim into collaboration. \\n\\xa0\\nFirst hand experience\\n\\xa0\\nAhmad Salim is a former and presumably repentant collaborator from the Hebron region.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHamas spiritual leader AhmadYasin survived attempt on his life\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe explains how the Shin Beth gets a person implicated in this “filthy business”.\\n\\xa0\\n“At the beginning, they (Shin Beth) wouldn’t ask you to inform on anybody or do something serious.

Rejection of it, and the subsequent uprising, was thus blamed by Israel on an intransigent Palestinian leadership.\\nBut critics of the plan point out that with no territorial contiguity for the Palestinian state, no control of its external borders, limited control of its own water resources, and continued Israeli military rights over much of the West Bank, the state on offer was not worthy of the name. Moreover, the plan ignored the right of return for millions of Palestinian refugees.\\nConsequently, they blame the Israelis for the breakdown in negotiations, which dashed the hopes of ordinary Palestinians in the Occupied Territories and inflamed tensions that boiled over two months later.\\nSharon’s visit\\nMany Palestinians and Israelis had warned Sharon’s visit would lead to riots. But the Likud Party leader insisted he would go to the site with what he claimed was a message of peace. Once on the site, however, he declared it eternal Israeli territory. \\nMany Israelis, however, deny Sharon’s visit caused the new Intifada.

And Arafat was accused of not doing enough to condemn Palestinian rioting and attacks.\\xa0However, the Mitchell Report said there was no evidence to indicate the Intifada had been planned, although some Palestinian officials were quoted as saying an uprising was likely if peace talks failed.\\nSome observers point out that Arafat had previously been rather zealous in detaining Palestinian radicals opposed to peace negotiations. \\nBut his ability to act was increasingly undermined by popular Palestinian anger at rapidly increasing illegal Jewish settlements and land seizures by the Israelis.\\nOnce the peace talks collapsed, and especially after rioting Palestinians were shot by Israeli soldiers, Arafat’s control over events was greatly weakened. \\n',\n",

Muslim leaders in the West Bank and Gaza Strip believe that nearly half of Palestinians support the Islamist movement in one way or another. \\nThe Intifada effect\\nThere seems to be a consensus that the political map in the West Bank and Gaza is changing as a result of the “Al-Aqsa” Intifada or uprising against the Israeli occupation – now in its\\xa0fourth year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArafat has lost out to\\xa0Hamas\\n\\n\\n\\nArafat has lost out to\\xa0Hamas\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe loss of confidence in the peace process to deliver a permanent agreement on acceptable terms has had a dramatic impact on the level of Palestinian support for violence against Israel, said Dr Khalil Shikaki, director of the Ram Allah-based Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research.\\xa0Hamas has been able to capitalise on these sentiments. “I think Hamas’ option of resistance gained a lot of popular support during the second Intifadah. I am talking about the option and not Hamas as an organisation,” said Abd al-Aziz al-Rantissi, a Hamas spokesman. \\n“Any movement which resists the Israeli occupiers has popular support. We symbolise Palestinian strength in the face of Israeli attacks.”\\xa0Legitimacy\\xa0Today, Hamas is a force to be reckoned with. It has grown in\\xa0strength since the outbreak of the Intifada. \\nIt has also established a network of schools, clinics, orphanages and offers financial support to many of the impoverished Palestinians. \\xa0“The Intifada has lent legitimacy to Hamas,” Ziad Abu Amr, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council said. “The peace process collapsed giving credence to Hamas’ opposition to the Oslo accords. \\nAlso, when the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its factions, security services and individuals became involved in the Intifada – this meant they drifted towards the viewpoint of Hamas and not the peacemaking views of the Palestinian Authority.”\\xa0The success of the Islamist groups may also have contributed to the decision of Fatah to return to armed resistance under its military wing, the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.\\xa0“Hamas gained a lot because of the corruption in the Palestinian Authority. Hamas presented itself as a clean movement,” said Abu Amr, who has written a book about Palestinian Islamist groups.\\n“The PA has been subjected to an Israeli campaign of destruction weakening its capabilities. Today, the PA is weak – also because of its bad governance – making the circumstances opportune for Hamas.”\\xa0Statistics compiled recently released by pollsters from the Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre\\xa0show a vast majority of Palestinians – 82.7% – believe the PA is corrupt and lacks the will to reform.\\xa0The jury is out as to whether support for the Islamist movements will overtake Fatah.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Recent Israeli attacks against Arafat and American attempts to find a replacement for him have only strengthened his position among his people”\\nGhassan Khatib,Jerusalem Media Communications Centre \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s a pluralistic society, Fatah is the ruling party and it has been there all along,” Abu Amr explained. “Fatah has institutions, a bureaucracy and it is the largest employer.”\\xa0But the Islamists are hard on Fatah’s tail.\\n\\n“I think the election box will answer that question,” al-Rantissi said. “At the moment and as the Intifada continues, the Palestinian street is controlled by all Palestinian factions – nationalists and Islamists.”\\xa0Allies\\nThe Intifada has made Hamas and Fatah de facto allies against the Israelis. “If the peace process is revived, there may be changes like in 1996 when Hamas stood against the PA’s decision to implement peace agreements with Israel,”\\xa0 explained JMCC spokesman, Ghassan\\xa0Khatib.\\nBut Shikaki believes the Intifada has divided the Palestinian house even further. “It crystallised two important trends with Palestinian politics and society. A split between old and young within the nationalist movement has greatly constrained the PA leadership’s capacity to manage the current crisis.” \\nThe second, a broader decline in power of the nationalists relative to the Islamists such as Hamas has created a long term challenge to the nationalists’ ability to lead the Palestinian people.”\\xa0That is one of Arafat’s major worries. The Palestinian president has always had to maintain a balance between US and Israeli demands and the desires of his people – many of whom have given their hearts and minds to Hamas. \\nArafat’s position may be weakening, but the dynamics of Palestinian politics are also shoring up his support. “Recent Israeli attacks against him and American attempts to find a replacement for him have only strengthened his position among his people,” said Khatib.\\n',\n",

              "       'In December 1987, after enduring occupation for more than 20 years, the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank\\xa0erupted in the face of their occupiers.\\nWhat became known as the Intifada was sparked by the killing of four labourers and the wounding of 10 others in Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp in December 1987. The workers were on their way back home from Israel when an Israeli lorry driver steered his vehicle straight into the two small pickup vehicles carrying them home. \\nSince June 1967, the Palestinians had hoped that their Arab brothers would come to their rescue. They saw the defeat of Arab nationalism, the loss of Egypt into the Camp David peace treaty with Israel and the successive blows dealt to the PLO in Jordan, the Lebanon and within the occupied territories.\\nOn the inside, they watched helplessly as their land slipped out of their hand. Their olive, fig and orange groves and vineyards were being turned into Jewish settlements to accommodate foreigners who had arrived from the USA and the USSR to claim a mythical inheritance.\\nMany of their young men and women, who had been lured into Israeli markets to provide labour were being corrupted and some had been turned into collaborators. Simply put, the Palestinians could not take any more humiliation.\\nThe Islamic alternative\\nBut while disgust and anger were fuel to the Intifada, the revolt could not have been sustained for five years without a well-organised mobilisation. This was provided by an emerging trend that in itself was the fruit of an Islamic revival going back to the early 1970s.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHamas activists lead protesters in the 1987 uprising\\n\\n\\n\\nHamas activists lead protesters in the 1987 uprising\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNevertheless, it was in the aftermath of the 1982 expulsion of the PLO from the Lebanon that the Islamic trend started emerging as a credible alternative to the failing nationalist trend. The reason lay in the decision of the post-1982 PLO to seek a compromise with the occupiers, based on accepting UN resolution 242 which entails recognising the right of the state of Israel to exist.\\nThe loss of hope in the international community, in the Arab governments and in the “sole legitimate representative” of the Palestinian people created a vacuum that could only be filled by an ideology and a spirituality that promised deliverance and provided motivation and hope.\\nAn earlier manifestation of this Islamic trend was the Islamic Jihad group of Palestine which planned and executed a number of audacious attacks against Israeli military targets in the 1980s. \\nHowever, the most important development accompanying the December 1987 ‘revolution’ was the emergence of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, which in essence was a transformation of the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine from a social and educational grassroots organisation into a national liberation movement.\\nFaith and stones\\nFor many months after its eruption, the Palestinian Intifada puzzled the Israelis and international observers. It even stunned the leaders of the PLO who had not anticipated it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Intifada made many Israelis consider seriously the prospect of a total collapse of their Zionist dream in Palestine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPalestinians learned from the first Intifada that military might alone is incapable of determining the overall balance of power. Armed with nothing but faith and stones, they saw the Israeli military machine crumble before their eyes. So much was the Israeli frustration that Yitzhak Rabin in his capacity as defence minister expressed the wish of waking up one day to be told that Gaza had been swallowed by the sea.\\nIsrael seemed\\xa0more vulnerable than ever. While Arab armies posed no threat and constituted no source of anxiety for Israelis, the Intifada made many\\xa0of them consider seriously the prospect of a total collapse of their Zionist dream in Palestine.\\nAfter a long absence from the reckoning of the Palestinians, Islam was by now becoming the main source of inspiration. After 40 years of misery and tribulation, they came to learn the hard way that no ideology and no way of life could empower them to face up to the Israelis, but that of Islam.\\nSolidarity\\nDespite competition and occasional friction, the Palestinians realised that they could not confront occupation, let alone bring it to an end, unless they avoided the temptation to engage in internal strife. Occupation had to be seen as the only threat and the only enemy.\\nThe PLO leadership outside Palestine sought to translate the uprising into political dividends. Anxious about the Islamicisation of the conflict in the Middle East, the Israelis and their US allies sought a partner for a peaceful settlement from among the Palestinian secular elite.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArafat’s jubilant arrival in Gaza on 1 July 1994 marked the end of the 1987 Intifada but certainly not the end of resistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe end of the first Gulf War, which drove Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait, was an excellent opportunity for launching the peace initiative that brought the Arabs and the Israelis to Madrid and then Washington.\\nThis initiative, which promised a peaceful end to the conflict, and the severe repressive measures adopted by the Israelis to curb Palestinian activism, contributed to a sharp decline in popular involvement in daily Intifada activities that had by 1992 become increasingly militarised.\\nArafat returns\\nThe Oslo agreement between the PLO and Israel in September 1993 facilitated the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA) under the leadership of Yasir Arafat. Less than a year later he and the bulk of the PLO leadership in the diaspora, were permitted to return to Gaza and the West Bank. Arafat’s jubilant arrival in Gaza on 1 July 1994 marked the end of the 1987 Intifada, but certainly not the end of resistance.\\nFor seven years afterwards, the Palestinians were divided. On the one hand there were those who wanted to give peace a chance, believing the Madrid and Oslo agreements to be legitimate dividends of the struggle. On the other hand there were those who saw in the peace process nothing but a conspiracy aimed at rescuing Israel from the serious predicament created by the Intifada.\\nAs negotiations proceeded at various levels, all the Israelis seemed interested in was turning the Palestinian Authority into a collaborating agency that kept the peace on their behalf. Palestinian negotiators were pressed for, and made, more concessions. The PA was expected to crack down on Palestinians who opposed the peace process or resisted occupation.\\nThe real issues in the conflict, such as the control of Jerusalem, the refugees, Jewish settlements, borders and water resources, kept being relegated to what become known as the ‘permanent status’ negotiations. In the meantime, more land was being confiscated under the guise of peace.\\nFractured territories\\nNew Jewish settlements were set up and many existing ones beefed up or expanded for alleged security reasons. To provide Jewish settlers with safe rides between their settlements and Israeli coastal towns, hundreds of miles of highways for their exclusive use were constructed on lands seized from Palestinians.\\nThe West Bank and Gaza Strip were so brutally carved up that Palestinian towns and villages were turned into isolated and scattered islets or “Bantustans”. Even the most senior PA officials, including Arafat himself, could not move from one part to another in the territories without prior permission from the Israelis.\\nThe peace process eventually came to a halt with the failure of the Camp David talks. For 15 days starting on 11 July 2000, with US President Bill Clinton as the host, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat discussed in vain such intractable issues as the status of Palestinian refugees, the status of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and Gaza, and the status of Jerusalem.\\nThe spark\\nAssassinations, detentions, reprisals, incursions, closures and other collective punishment measures became commonplace. Israel turned the entire Palestinian population into a barrel of dynamite that only needed a spark to set it off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeavy Israeli presence inside al-Aqsa mosque compound\\xa0today\\n\\n\\n\\nHeavy Israeli presence inside al-Aqsa mosque compound\\xa0today\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Ariel Sharon, the then leader of the Likud opposition, who provided it. On Thursday 28 September 2000, protected by hundreds of armed guards he\\xa0entered al-Masjid al-Aqsa mosque, one of Islam’s holiest sites, which the Israelis claim to be the site of a Jewish temple. The protests this calculated provocation set off marked the beginning of the second Intifada.\\nThe most remarkable development accompanying the eruption of the second Intifada was the birth of Fatah’s military wing al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades (AMB). This was seen as clear proof of the loss of faith even within the main PLO faction, Fatah, in making peace with the Israelis.\\n‘Stillborn’ roadmap\\nOver the past three years, numerous attempts have been made to revive the peace process, but to no avail. The most recent stillborn initiative was the “road map proposed by the so-called Quartet: the USA, the UN, Russia and the European Union.\\nThe failure has not been down to lack of opportunity. One golden chance which the Israelis and their US allies wasted was the unilateral declaration of\\xa0a ceasefire\\xa0by the Palestinian factions including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. \\nThe Israelis rejected the truce insisting that Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas do what was expected of him by the “road map”.\\nAccepting nothing short of the total dismantlement of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, the Israelis scuppered Abbas’s cabinet, brought his political life to an end and gave more oxygen to the Intifada.\\n(Azzam Tamimi is Director of the Institute of Islamic Political Thought in London and Senior Lecturer at the Markfield Institute of Higher Education in Leicestershire, UK)\\n',\n",
              "       'The current Palestinian Intifada or uprising for statehood has seen a dramatic shift in tactics by an increasingly coordinated armed resistance, Dr Abd al-Sattar Kassem told Aljazeera.\\nToday’s struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine is a far cry from the stone-throwing and mass public demonstrations that marked the beginning of the current Intifada in late 2000, he said.\\nWith the peace process in shreds, continued conflict seems inevitable for the foreseeable future, and through the cold analysis of numbers of dead, the Palestinians seem to be having more success than ever before.\\nProtest too costly\\nPalestinians claim that the disproportionate Israeli response to the protests and stone-throwing at Israeli checkpoints is what escalated the current conflict. Too many protesting Palestinians were being shot leading to a drastic change of approach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStone-throwing is no longer the symbol of the Intifada\\n\\n\\n\\nStone-throwing is no longer the symbol of the Intifada\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Each day around eight Palestinians were being killed at checkpoint protests, once 12 in a single day. So the Palestinians retaliated,” Kassem said. \\n\\n“This is no longer an Intifada. The majority support the armed resistance, but there are fewer people protesting in the streets.”\\nThe major tactical shift by the Palestinian resistance came in summer 2001. A spate of\\xa0human bombings in Israeli towns killed more than 40 people\\xa0from May to August. The region had seen people blowing themselves up before, but these attacks were part of an organised\\xa0assault that left Israel reeling.\\nThe Israeli army stepped up its own campaign to wipe out the resistance groups and their sponsors, but throughout 2002 coordinated attacks continued to claim hundreds of lives.\\nAt least 800\\xa0Israeli soldiers and civilians have been killed in the current conflict. The Palestinians have lost 2480 many of whom were children, giving a ratio of 3:1. Given the disparity of the two sides’ weaponry, Palestinian resistance groups have hailed this as a success.\\nNew hardware\\nThe clampdown on Palestinians through methods such as the building of an apartheid wall, curfews and increased isolation and security around Palestinian island towns in Israeli occupied areas will make it harder for\\xa0the bombers to get through, the Israeli authorities say. \\nBut this is forcing armed resistance of groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad to seek new, more sophisticated ways of launching attacks into Israeli-held territory, including conventional rockets.\\nFor the moment, the tactics have become those of guerrilla warfare.\\xa0 \\nHamas have fired Qassam rockets and mortars from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory. They may have generated more noise and fear than actual damage – one person was killed out of the\\xa0tens of mortars and rockets that have been aimed at Israeli-held areas.\\nGuerrilla war\\nShimon Romach, a former member of the Israel Security Agency (ISA), told\\xa0Aljazeera, “I would call it guerrilla warfare. The difference between the first Intifada and this one is much greater use of weapons by the Palestinians. During the first Intifada there was a limited number of weapons and explosives in Gaza, as Israel was ruling the territories.”\\nThe main characteristics of the first Intifada, between 1987 and 1992, was public demonstrations and people throwing stones at Israeli tanks and checkpoints.\\nRomach claimed that Israel’s relaxed grip on the territories made an armed uprising more likely this time. “When the PLO came back into Palestine (in 1994) with armed forces and guns, the ground was laid for a very different kind of Intifada.”\\nThe Israelis have tried to keep the war in Palestinian territory, keeping suspected attackers out through strengthened checkpoints and by targeting resistance leaders in their homes. \\nShortly into the current Intifada, they started facing war on their own turf. Romach said it was this that has forced Israel to resort to a\\xa0firmer military response.\\n“The high point came a year and a half ago with a ‘suicide’ bombing in the Park Hotel in Netanya (on 27 March 2002, killing 29 civilians),” he said. “After that Israel escalated its reaction.”\\nFalse dawn\\nHunting for the heads of the Palestinian armed sections, the Israeli army overran the Palestinian towns of Nablus and Jenin. Houses were bulldozed and dozens of Palestinian non-combatants killed in incursions that were roundly condemned by the international community.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeorge Bush’s “road map” plan has\\xa0hit\\xa0a dead end\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nGeorge Bush’s “road map” plan has\\xa0hit\\xa0a dead end\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe peace plan hailed by George Bush at the end of 2002, the so-called “road map”, proved a false dawn. \\n\\nWith Islamic resistance groups enjoying almost equal or even more support in the polls as Yasir Arafat’s Fatah movement, the US-backed prime minister Mahmud Abbas’ attempt to rein in the resistance fighters was doomed to failure.\\n“The Palestinian Authority has very little power,” said Kassem, a vociferous critic of Arafat. “Only those that receive salaries support it.”\\xa0Under the unilateral ceasefire declared in June 2003, Palestinian resistance groups did hold off from attacking Israeli troops and civilians, but Israel did not reciprocate. \\nThey continued to assassinate Palestinian activists, kill and wound bystanders, and destroy homes in Palestinian towns, while claiming to be attacking “terrorist infrastructure”.\\nThe Israelis decision to ignore the truce may have made trust between the two sides an impossibility.\\nHamas’ patience ran out\\xa0on 19 August with a huge bus bombing in Jerusalem that killed 22 people. \\nApartheid wall\\nSince then Israel has scaled up\\xa0its helicopter rocket strikes on homes of suspected resistance fighters in the West Bank and Gaza, and both sides are more belligerent than ever. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA stretch of the apartheid wall near\\xa0Qalqilya in\\xa0the West Bank\\n\\n\\n\\nA stretch of the apartheid wall near\\xa0Qalqilya in\\xa0the West Bank\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe apartheid wall, known to Israelis as the separation or security fence, is a new weapon in Israel’s war against the Palestinians aspirations to statehood. \\n\\nIt purports to keep Palestinian attackers out of Israeli-controlled areas, but is also a controversial attempt to pre-empt the borders of a future two-state solution to the Palestinian question, critics say.\\nInstead of sticking to the “green line” marking the West Bank’s boundary, much of the planned 370-mile fence, 100 miles of which has already been built, cuts deep into Palestinian land. \\nTo include the Israeli settlement of Ariel, where 18,000 people live, the barrier would have to swing eastwards 12 miles into the West Bank.\\nThe US has opposed the building of the fence on Palestinian land and has threatened to deduct the cost from around $8 billion of loan guarantees it has given Israel. \\nIsraeli prime minister Ariel Sharon told Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli daily, on 27 September\\xa0that American pressure had forced him to change his policy, \\n“The Americans were sensitive about construction in the Ariel area. We were worried about the loan guarantees, their intention to deduct the sum invested in the fence from the guarantees. It was agreed that the fence would not enclose the Ariel area.”\\nSharon’s compromise was to say that a heavily-guarded “breach” would be left in the fence, giving Israel the option of extending the barrier to include Ariel at a later stage.\\nYedioth Ahronoth also reported on its website last week that one section of the apartheid wall would have a new measure to minimise further the risk of Israeli military casualties.\\n“The separation fence to be built in the Gilboa region will include remote-control machine guns that will be operated by female soldiers from their command posts and will shoot at those suspected of being terrorists,” the paper said on its website, citing Israeli army sources\\nThe sources did not mention how such people will be identified.\\nHatred\\nThe increasing radicalisation of both Israeli and Palestinian populations – due to decades of conflict of which this Intifada is only the most recent chapter – means that very few Palestinians are interested in having the Israelis listen to their cause and vice versa.\\nNegotiation has been replaced by bitter opposition. Israeli security expert Romach said he did not believe things would change under Sharon.\\n“The current Israeli regime will never negotiate with Arafat,” he said. “They have the support of the Americans in this. The only chance for change is the Labour party winning an election.”\\n',\n",

We asked what came to their mind when they heard the words ‘Israeli/Palestinian conflict’ and then what was the source of whatever it was. \\n\\n\\n\\nIsraelis are often seen as the only victims in the conflict and Palestinians the aggressors\\n\\n\\n\\nIsraelis are often seen as the only victims in the conflict and Palestinians the aggressors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle understanding\\nMost (82%) listed TV news as their source and these replies showed that they had absorbed the ‘main’ message of the news, of conflict, violence and tragedy, but that many people had little understanding of the reasons for the conflict and its origins.\\nExplanations were rarely given on the news and when they were, journalists often spoke obliquely, almost in a form of short-hand. \\nFor example, in a news bulletin which featured the progress of peace talks, a journalist made a series of very brief comments on the issues which underpinned the conflict.\\nJournalist: The basic raw disagreements remain – the future, for example, of this city Jerusalem, the future of Jewish settlements and the returning refugees. (ITN:18.30,16.10.2001)\\nSuch a statement requires background knowledge to be understood. ‘Refugees’ are cited as a key issue.\\nOur main audience sample of 300 young people were asked where these Palestinian refugees had come from and how they had become refugees? Just\\xa08% knew that the refugees were displaced from their homes and land when Israel was established in 1948. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“It would not have taken long on the news to say that much of the Palestinian economy depended on water and that each Israeli now consumed three times as much water as a Palestinian.”\\nGreg Philo, research director of Glasgow University media group\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForcible expulsion\\nThis was, in the words of the Israeli historian Avi Shlaim, the result of a ‘Jewish Military Offensive’ designed to “clear the interior of the future Israeli state” and involved the ‘forcible expulsion of Arab civilians’.\\nVery few knew of this or that shortly after these events a major war broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbours which occasioned more people to flee. \\nMany of the refugees moved to Gaza (which came underthe control of Egypt) and to the West Bank of the Jordan river (under Jordanian control).\\nTo understand the journalist statement the viewer would need to know that in 1967 Israel fought a further war with its Arab neighbours and in the process of this, occupied Gaza and the West Bank, thus bringing the Palestinian refugees under its military control. \\nEast Jerusalem, which has great religious and cultural significance for both Israelis and Palestinians was also occupied (taken from Jordan).\\nCrucial resource\\nThese military occupations were bitterly resisted by the Palestinians, not least because Israel built ‘settlements’ all across the militarily occupied territories.\\nThis was much more than simply building houses and farms. As Avi Shlaim suggests they were part of a policy of exerting strategic and military control, by for example ‘surrounding the huge greater Jerusalem area with two concentric circles of settlements with access roads and military positions’ (2000: 582).\\nThe settlements were also built so that they could exploit the crucial resource of water in the occupied territories. \\nIt would not have taken long on the news to say that much of the Palestinian economy depended on water and that each Israeli now consumed three times as much water as a Palestinian. \\n\\n\\n\\nWestern media largely ignore\\xa0images like this of a Palestinian\\xa0child injured by Israeli gun fire\\n\\n\\n\\nWestern media largely ignore\\xa0images like this of a Palestinian\\xa0child injured by Israeli gun fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur interviewees knew very little of such matters. We analysed TV news coverage of the major ‘Intifada’ (or uprising) by the Palestinians, which began in September 2000.\\nWe focused on the lunchtime, early evening and late night news on BBC1 and ITN, since these attract very large audiences. \\nThe bulletins from 28th September until 16th October 2000 (total of 89 bulletins) were transcribed and the number of lines of text which were devoted to different themes were counted (e.g. how many described fighting / violence, or peace negotiations or explanations of the conflict etc). \\nMilitary occupation\\nOf 3536 lines of text in total, only 17 explained the history of the conflict. The key issue of water was barely mentioned. It was apparent that many people did not understand that the Palestinians were subject to a military occupation and did not know who was “occupying” the occupied territories.\\nOn TV news, journalists sometimes used the word “occupied” but did not explain that the Israelis were involved in a military occupation. \\nIt is perhaps not surprising then that many in the audience did not understand the nature of the “occupation”. In the sample of 300 young people, 71% did not know that it was the Israelis who were occupying the territories. \\nOnly 9% knew that it was the Israelis and that the settlers were Israeli. There were actually more people (11%) who believed that the Palestinians were occupying the territories and that the settlers were Palestinian.\\nSo why does the news not give proper explanations of the history and context of events?\\nLack of discussion\\nOne reason is that the news exists in a very commercial market concerned with audience ratings. \\nPictures and action dominate and it is better it have great pictures of being in the middle of a riot with journalists ducking stones than to explain what the conflict is about.\\nThere is a second perhaps more crucial reason why the TV newsrooms do not dwell on history and origins of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the sample of 300 young people, 71% did not know that it was the Israelis who were occupying the territories. Glasgow University media group\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is that to refer to them as under-lying the violence could be very controversial. \\nIsrael is closely allied to the United States and there are very strong pro-Israel lobbies in the US and to some extent in Britain. \\nIt is clear that a lack of discussion on the news of the origins of the conflict and the controversial aspects of the occupation would operate in favour of Israel. \\nIllegal settlements\\nFor example, Israel prefers to stress the attacks and bombings made upon it and the alleged anti-semitism of some Islamist groups, rather than to have the legality of its own actions subject to public debate. \\nThe settlement policy is widely regarded as illegal in International Law and this has certainly been the view of the British Government. \\nSome newspaper reports consistently refer to the settlements as “illegal” but this is not done routinely on television news. \\nWithout the discussion of origins and causes, we are left with accounts on the news of day to day events, in which it can appear that the ‘normal’ world is disrupted only when the Palestinians riot or bomb. \\nThis is of course the view of the Israeli Government and the news tended to oscillate between this and the view that violence was perpetrated by both sides in a ‘cycle’ of ‘tit for tat’ killings. \\nThe Palestinians believe that they are resisting an illegal and violent occupation. From the Israeli government view the Palestinian militants are merely terrorists to whom they are “responding.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIsrael prefers to stress the attacks and bombings made upon it and the anti-semitism of some Islamic groups, rather than to have the legality of its own actions subject to public debate. \\n\\nGreg Philo, research director at Glasgow University media group\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIsraeli counter-attacks\\nThere were many examples of the Israeli viewpoint being actively adopted by journalists and built into the structure of coverage. \\nPalestinian bombings were frequently presented as ‘starting’ a sequence of events which involved an Israeli ‘response’, as in “Dozens of Palestinians and Israelis have been killed in a relentless round of suicide bombings and Israeli counter-attacks.” (BBC2 Newsnight 22:30 13/12/01)\\nOn BBC Radio 4 it was reported that “Five Palestinians have been killed when the Israeli army launched new attacks on the Gaza Strip in retaliation for recent acts of terrorism.” (07:30: 06/03/02) \\nIn another extraordinary exchange on BBC Radio 4, David Wiltshire MP, was asked “What can the Egyptians do to stop the suicide bombers – because that in the end is what is cranking up the violence at present?” He replies, “Well that is one view, the Israeli view.” (17:00 01/04/02) \\nOn Channel Four News a journalist reports that: “The Israelis had carried out this demolition in retaliation for the murder of our soldiers”. (10/01/02) The extent to which some journalism simply assumes the Israeli perspective can be seen if the statements are ‘reversed ‘ and presented as Palestinian actions. \\nThe group did not find any reports stating that ‘The Palestinian attacks were in retaliation for the murder of those resisting the illegal Israeli occupation’. \\nEndorse neutrality\\nThe incursions by Israeli forces into Palestinian towns\\xa0on 2\\xa0April,\\xa0caused heavy loss of life and much International criticism. \\nOn BBC Radio 4 news they were described using the phrase ‘there is a determination to carry on until the job is done'(9/4/02). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid presented as Goliath?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWould Palestinian attacks be described in this fashion? A news journalism which seeks neutrality should not endorse any point of view, but there were many departures from this principle.\\nThe analysis found other differences in the manner in which Palestinians and Israelis were described in news reporting. Words such as “murder”, “atrocity”, “lynching” and “savage cold-blooded killing” were only used to describe Israeli deaths but not those of Palestinians. \\nTerrible fates befell both Israelis and Palestinians but there was a clear difference in the language used to describe them. This was so even when the events being described had strong similarities. \\nFor example, on 10th of October 2000 it was reported that Arab residents of Tel Aviv had been chased and stabbed. This was described on ITN as “angry Jews looking for Arab victims” (ITN 18.30 10.10.2000) In the Guardian (10.10.2000), these events were described as a pogrom. \\nThe reports on television news were extremely brief but two days later when two Israeli soldiers were killed by a crowd of Palestinians there was very extensive coverage and the words “lynching” and “lynch mob” were very widely used. \\nThis difference in the use of language is noteworthy. This is especially so since in this period, at the beginning of the Intifada, nearly ten times as many Palestinians had in fact been killed as Israelis. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIsraelis spoke twice as much on television news as Palestinians and there were three times as many headlines that expressed the Israeli view as that of the Palestinians.\\nGlasgow University media group\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe news, on the occasions when it did give figures, stated that more Palestinians had died than Israelis, but only 30% of our sample of 300 young people believed this to be so.\\nThe same number believed either that the Israelis had the most casualties or that casualties were equal for both sides. \\nThere were a number of other imbalances in the way in which the two sides were reported. Israelis spoke twice as much on television news as Palestinians and there were three times as many headlines that expressed the Israeli view as that of the Palestinians.\\nPowerful forces\\nThe TV news did feature some criticism of Israel particularly for using ‘excessive force’, but it was clear from our work that such criticism was sometimes muted – e.g. a lethal attack by a helicopter gunship was described using the phrase ‘Israel wielded a big stick’ (BBC1 1800 4/10/00). \\nMore severe criticism emerged from Israel itself, when Shimon Perez, the Israeli Foreign Minister was reported in October 2001 as trying to ‘reign in’ the Israeli Army which was accused of deliberately seeking to wreck a ceasefire by opening fire on protesters. \\nThe notion that there are powerful forces within Israel who do not wish there to be any peace settlement was rarely explored on television news.\\nThis seems also to have forgotten how the present Intifada began when Ariel Sharon walked through the most holy Muslim sights, producing wide spread protests.\\nNo restraint\\nOn the first day four Palestinians were reported as shot dead and 150 wounded. In our research in October 2000, we found that some television news did report that Israeli soldiers were ‘showing absolutely no restraint, firing live ammunition into crowds from\\xa020 metres’ (ITN 18.00 22.10.2000). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You always think of Palestiniansas being aggressive because of the news” – focus group member\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it was not suggested at this time that the actions of the army might be linked to a political agenda (i.e. to stop the peace process). \\nIn contrast the view put forward by the Israeli Government at the time that Yasir Arafat was encouraging violence for political ends – was widely reported and discussed on TV news.\\nThe lack of explanation on the news about the origins of the conflict plus the differences in the manner in which both ‘sides’ were presented had measurable effects on some public understanding. \\nAs one\\xa018-year-old in a focus group commented: “You always think of the Palestinians as being really aggressive because of the stories you hear on the news. I always put the blame on them in my own head.”\\n* Greg Philo is Research Director of the Glasgow University Media Group. \\xa0His next book is Bad News from Israel (Pluto 2004).

But they are yet to happen. \\n“In the first Intifada in 1987, our message was we will not accept occupation forever. We will not accept subjugation. We want peace,” said Dr Saib Uraikat, chief Palestinian negotiator. \\nMore than\\xa010 years later, that message is still the same. \\n“We are still fighting to end the occupation. We still want peace,” said the veteran peace negotiator.\\nLifeless process\\xa0 \\n“We do not have a peace process – not even a minimal component of a peace process,” said Dr Azmi Bashara, a Palestinian Member of Israel’s Knesset (parliament).\\xa0 \\nOver the last three years any trust that was painstakingly built between the two sides has been shattered. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“In the first Intifada in 1987 our message was we will not accept occupation forever…We are still fighting to end the occupation.

Even four months after the uprising erupted in September 2000, delegations met in Taba, Egypt to hammer out a deal. \\n“Before the Intifada there were talks and signs of hope. Now this has disappeared,” said Sarid bleakly. \\nHopes at Taba\\nPalestinians and Israelis were closest to clinching a deal ending more than half a century of pain at Taba, an Egyptian resort on the Red Sea.\\nFrom 21 to 27 January 2001 Palestinian and Israel delegations, mediated by the European Union’s special Middle East envoy Miguel Angel Moratinus,\\xa0worked to find common ground on issues including refugees, security, borders and the fate of Jerusalem. \\nAt Taba, Israel presented a contiguous map of the West Bank, unlike the proposal put forward at Camp David in July 2000. \\nAt the US presidential retreat of Camp David, the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had proposed annexing a strategic chunk of the occupied West Bank and creating Palestinian cantons surrounded by Jewish settlements. \\nThe West Bank would be further divided by “bypass roads” snaking throughout the future “independent” Palestinian state. \\n\\n\\n\\nYossi Beilin (L) with Saib Uraikatat the Taba talks in Egypt\\n\\n\\n\\nYossi Beilin (L) with Saib Uraikatat the Taba talks in Egypt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the end, this proved the talks’ undoing.\\nSparks of hope, however, flickered at the Taba negotiations. \\nThey were “unprecedented in their positive atmosphere and expression of mutual willingness to meet the national, security and existential needs of each side,” according to a joint statement issued by the two sides following the negotiations. \\n“The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections,” according to the optimistic statement. \\nBut when Ariel Sharon was elected Israel’s prime minister in February 2001, he immediately declared an end to all talks until Palestinians halted their uprising against Israel’s occupation. \\n“We needed more time,” said Uraikat. \\nReviving the\\xa0spirit \\nBoth sides are\\xa0pessimistic about the future of the Palestinian question in the current climate. \\nPeace talks such as Taba cannot take place today because the negotiators on the Israeli side – “the champions of that source of reason in peace” \\xa0– have all but vanished, said\\xa0 Bashara. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“If we are waiting for the world, the world will not save us.”\\nYossi Beilin, Israeli MK\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSarid echoed similar sentiments. \\n“With Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat it will be difficult to revive spirit of Taba,” he said, adding the two sides were not even ready to sit down for such serious negotiations. \\nBut Uraikat stressed the only road to peace was through talks. \\n“You cannot solve the situation through the construction of walls or settlements. Assassinations will not bring peace,” he said. “Negotiations will save lives on both sides.” \\nDespite Israel’s continuing occupation, Uraikat is optimistic. \\n“Peace is inevitable between the Palestinians and Israelis,” he said.\\xa0 \\nYossi Beilin, an Israeli MK, said the peace process could be revived if both sides\\xa0took the initiative. \\n“If we are waiting for the world, the world will not save us,” said Beilin, who was heavily involved in the Oslo peace accords and the Taba talks. \\nLessons learned \\nWhen the first Intifada erupted, Yitzhak Shamir held the reins of power in Israel. Bashara said Shamir preferred to deal with the uprising through the use of\\xa0force. The former Israeli premier also refused to have any contacts with the PLO. \\nThe late Yitzhak Rabin, who succeeded Shamir, took a different tack. He opted to\\xa0negotiate directly with the PLO, which led to the 1993 Oslo peace accords.\\n\\n\\n\\nAriel Sharon (C)\\xa0 believes inusing military might\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAriel Sharon (C)\\xa0 believes inusing military might\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sharon’s government is handling the Intifada in a manner similar to the Shamir government,” said\\xa0Bashara. \\xa0\\nThe Israeli premier believes in flexing Israel’s military might to break the will of the other side, illustrated by the fact that “Sharon believes the most successful war was in 1982”. \\nHe was referring to Sharon’s disastrous invasion of Lebanon, crowned by the Sabra and Shatila massacres. More than 2000 civilians were slaughtered under Sharon’s command, who was then Israel’s defence minister. \\n“Sharon believes the Israelis should be patient,” added Bashara. \\nSarid warned against using force to solve the current conflict. \\n“If both sides lean on force, we are in the\\xa0middle of a tragedy.

This had sparked hope that violence would cease.\\n\\xa0\\nAnger\\n\\xa0\\nBut the killing of nearly 300 people over the past three weeks has forced hardliners in both India and Pakistan to stiffen their stances.\\n\\xa0\\nThe Indian government has expressed anger at the upsurge in violence. Pakistan has denied the charge it is behind the violence and has in turn resorted to its familiar India-bashing rhetoric.\\n\\xa0\\nThe killing on 30 August of Ghazi Baba, the commander of the separatist group Jaish-e-Muhammad,\\xa0was seen as a major breakthrough by the Indian security forces. \\n\\xa0\\nBaba was considered to be the alleged mastermind of the attack on the Indian Parliament.\\n\\xa0\\nIndia suffered its worst setback on 13 September when a former fighter, Kuka Parray who broke ranks and joined Indian security forces to combat the separatists, was killed.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian security forces stretched to the limit by Kashmiri separatists\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn his death, the Indian Army lost one of its most trusted men in Kashmir. Kuka had turned the tide in India’s favour by switching sides at the height of the previous phase of violence. \\n\\xa0\\nIndian Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani admitted his death was a “great loss” to India and pro-Indian forces in Kashmir. \\n\\xa0\\nThe killing came two weeks after one of Parray’s former associates Javed Hussain Shah was shot dead by attackers in the Kashmiri capital. \\n\\xa0\\nThat killing coincided with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s visit to Srinagar.\\n\\xa0\\nIf the killing of Ghazi Baba encouraged the Indian security forces to hunt for other key players in the struggle for independence, the killings of Parray and Shah motivated them to seek reprisals. \\n\\xa0\\nThe forces claimed\\xa0to have killed\\xa0more than 90 separatists, mostly Islamist fighters from outside India,\\xa0whom they refer to\\xa0as foreign mercenaries.\\n\\xa0\\nGruesome\\n\\xa0\\nBut in some of these cases, the residents disputed their claims. They took to the roads to protest against “gruesome killings” of the local youth in fake encounters. These refer to the killings of civilians who have been detained on the grounds of being separatists.\\n\\xa0\\nKashmir’s police chief Gopal Sharma denied his forces were killing civilians. “All those killed were either terrorists eliminated by us in encounters or civilians who were either caught in crossfire or targeted by the terrorists.” \\n\\xa0\\nNo one is sure why violence has spiralled of late. One of the several theories in circulation suggests that since India seems to be reluctant to talk to Pakistan on Kashmir, Islamabad must have decided to bring it to its knees.\\n\\xa0\\nSome try to link it to President Pervez Musharraf’s problems on the home front,\\xa0particularly the rise of the Islamists who want him to step down. \\n\\xa0\\n“If Kashmir is burning, he can silence his critics by pleading that in the national interest this is not the right time to disturb him,” says political commentator Tahir Muhiuddin. \\n\\xa0\\nWhat is also possible is that he may have no control at all over the Islamist outfits like the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad, known to be mainly involved in the violence in Kashmir. \\n\\xa0\\nBut the fact that the indigenous Kashmir group Hizb-ul-Mujahedin has also become active again places a question mark on such an observation.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia and Pakistan exchange angrywords over the increase in violence\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia and Pakistan exchange angrywords over the increase in violence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMuhiuddin feels that by encouraging more and more Kashmiri youth to cross the de-facto border to receive arms training, Pakistan as well as separatist groups\\xa0are looking\\xa0to dispel the Indian claim that it is now mainly “foreign mercenaries” who are creating trouble in Kashmir.\\n\\xa0\\nNeither wants to give the diplomatic edge to India, which will lose the argument if those killed or captured in Kashmir turn out to be locals. \\n\\xa0\\nInternal splits\\n\\xa0\\nThe internal struggles of Kashmiri groups are also having their own impact.\\n\\xa0\\nNew Delhi’s covert endeavour to win over the Hurriyat Conference suffered a setback as Kashmir’s main alliance of separatist parties split in early-September. \\n\\xa0\\nThe\\xa0 talk in Kashmir’s political circles before the split was that the alliance’s leadership was eager to begin talks with New Delhi to arrive at a settlement. \\n\\xa0\\nBut the\\xa0faction led by Geelani pre-empted the move by causing a split in the organisation.

Although wind power does not burn fossil fuel, it does affect the environment by clearing woodland to build noisy and unsightly towers. \\nBlowing in the wind\\nThe 100 people of Luzaga – in La Mancha about 200 km (125 miles) northeast of Madrid – are mobilising against a project by the Danish company Neg Micon to install 33 turbines outside town. \\n“We are not against wind power, but if they build a wind park here it will destroy the ecosystem surrounding the town,” said Celso Hernando, 31, who is leading the movement against a wind park in Luzaga, which is surrounded by pines and oak-covered hills. \\nBy itself the Castille-La Mancha region of Quixote’s travels has as much wind power as the Netherlands. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Because they can be seen, they provoke a reaction, which is something that does not happen with most power plants that pollute”\\xa0\\nJose Luis Garcia,\\xa0Greenpeace\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere could be more clashes. The government projects wind power capacity will nearly triple to 13,000 megawatts by 2011 to help meet demand and reach Kyoto Protocol targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \\nIf Neg Micon’s plan goes forward, the 48 million euro ($54 million) investment to build 49.5 megawatts capacity would provide clean energy for 100,000 people. \\n“The project would have a major impact on the environment by destroying a Mediterranean ecosystem that is very valuable from a botanical point of view and wildlife point of view,” said Alberto Mayor, a member of the environmental protection group Ecologists in Action. \\nEyesore pollution\\nNeg Micon says the ecologists do not have all their facts straight, but declined to go into detail.

              "       'Ayman al-Zawahri’s recent calls to arms could embarrass those who once fought alongside him back home, especially when they are trying to give up their legacy of armed opposition. \\nFor years a security nightmare before its leaders renounced violence in 1997, Egypt’s al-Jamaa al-Islamiya is desperately trying to reassure the state of its new ‘reformed’ line.\\nThe al-Jamaa’s 51-year-old leader Karam Zuhdi – who has been in prison since 1981 over his role in the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat the same year – caused a stir last July with a frank confession to the Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. \\nAsked what he would have done if he could turn back the clock, Zuhdi replied: “I would have intervened to prevent his murder … Sadat, may God bless his soul with mercy, is a martyr along with everyone who died in that fight.” \\nFrom killing the country’s former president to anointing his soul, Egypt’s largest armed opposition group has indeed travelled a long way. \\nThe al-Jamaa leaders launched a unilateral ceasefire initiative in July 1997, at a time when the group’s infrastructure outside prisons had been crippled by security blows. \\nBy then its insurgency had claimed the lives of more than 1000 people, mostly police officers, the al-Jamaa activists, and, on several occasions, Copts, tourists and secular intellectuals. \\nRenounciation of violence\\nThe group’s leadership, the Shura Council, followed their announcement by producing four revisionist studies. They reiterated that the government was not “infidel” after all, and renounced violence.\\nInitially the group’s calls fell on deaf ears. The regime distrusted the al-Jamaa, especially after one of\\xa0its units slaughtered 58 tourists and four Egyptians in November 1997, in Luxor. But later, following the 11 September 2001 attacks, the regime came to endorse the initiative.\\nThe government turnaround was confirmed in June 2002, when authorities allowed the editor of state-owned weekly Al-Mussawar to interview the al-Jamaa leaders inside jails. Since then, they have become media celebrities with their routine denunciation of terror. \\nMore importantly, recent crackdowns on Muslim opposition movements have not targeted al-Jamaa sympathisers, whose “good conduct” even earned them praise from the country’s interior minister. \\n“Nearly 1000 members of al-Jamaa al-Islamiya have been released over a period of time [three years] in line with clear guidelines and their commitment to rejecting violence,” Major General Habib al-Adly, Egypt’s minister of interior, told Al-Mussawar in September.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The al-Jamaa’s leadership is trying to steer the wheel towards moderation, while the global Islamist scene is going through radicalisation” \\nDiaa Rashwan, Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“All those who have been freed are living normally among the people and clearly state their rejection of violence and their total commitment to the initiative declared by the al-Jamaa leadership,” the minister added. Rights groups put the figure of Islamists in prisons at 15,000. \\nSell-outs\\nWhile the minister is pleased, yesterday’s comrades in arms from other groups remain furious. London-based Islamists such as Yasir al-Sirri and Hani al-Sebai have labelled the al-Jamaa’s moves a sell-out. \\n“These comments are coming from those who are not al-Jamaa al-Islamiya’s sons,” said lawyer Montasser al-Zayat in reply. Al-Zayat is a former al-Jamaa member who has acted as its de facto spokesman. \\n“They are commenting on an internal issue. The al-Jamaa did not force anyone to join its violence in the first place, so no one should instruct the al-Jamaa now on how to handle the initiative.” \\nBut the al-Jamaa’s revisions are not solely its “internal” business anymore. The group is touching the cornerstones of a deep legacy. The moves have already drawn a crescendo of criticism from London-based activists, including the Saudi-born dissident Muhammad al-Massari, and Syrian exile Abu Baseer.\\nObservers who have been closely monitoring the al-Jamaa’s development, like Muhammad Salah of Al Hayat, say the exiles’ criticism is unlikely to have an impact on the group. \\n“They will not listen to them,” said Salah. “Coming under external attack could even give more legitimacy to the al-Jamaa’s leadership (among its members).” \\nToo early to tell\\nIf its history is anything to go by, talks of a split may be premature. The al-Jamaa has always enjoyed a strong centralised command structrure, according to Diaa Rashwan, a researcher on Islamism at the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, a Cairo-based think tank. \\nThe group’s base cadres have been known for their ultra-loyalty to the leadership, a feature which has enabled it to maintain a strong chain of command, even inside prisons. Diaa believes that the Luxor massacre was unlikely an act of disobedience. \\nDisruption in the chain of command, resulting from the killing of middle-ranking operatives, severed communications between the leaders in prisons and the isolated Qena Unit that carried out the attack. “Word of the ceasefire did not reach the unit on time,”\\xa0 Rashwan told Aljazeera.\\nThe government itself seems to be betting on the group’s internal discipline to guarantee a consensus on the renunciation of violence. Authorities allowed the incarcerated al-Jamaa leaders to tour prisons in an attempt to win over\\xa0their followers to the new line. \\n“I was indeed astonished [to see] the al-Jamaa leaders having such immense power and influence on its members who have been in jails for a long time,” wrote Makram Ahmad of Al- Mussawar, recalling a dialogue conference he attended where four Shura Council leaders addressed 500 of their supporters.\\nOrganisational discipline was emphasised even in the conference. The four al-Jamaa leaders sat on the main platform with the 18 imprisoned provincial amirs behind them, facing the crowd. The generals and colonels were addressing their foot soldiers saying the war was over, and hardly anyone seemed to disagree then. \\nTwists and turns\\nHowever, the fact that the\\xa0al-Jamaa leaders revised their views in prison may yet add another twist to the turnaround. They have already faced criticism for bowing to security pressures. Asharq Al-Awsat has run several unconfirmed reports over the last year on a leadership split inside prisons. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe al-Jamma is trying to reconcilewith pro-western Egyptian \\xa0leaderHusni Mubarak (r)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe al-Jamma is trying to reconcilewith pro-western Egyptian \\xa0leaderHusni Mubarak (r)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbandoning armed opposition could not have happened at a less favourable time. “The Jamaah has always enjoyed a strong structure,” Zayat reiterates. “But sometimes the sea tide goes against the ship.”\\n“The al-Jamaa’s leadership is trying to steer the wheel towards moderation, while the global Islamist scene is going through radicalisation,” said Rashwan. “It should be no surprise that the transition would create some sort of turbulence inside the group. The new ideas have not been swallowed up completely yet.” \\nIdeas take time to absorb, but emerging signs of the new breed of unorganised armed opposition activist could leave the government little room to manoeuvre. \\nSince last January, and on a nearly monthly basis, security has been announcing crackdowns on “jihadis,” “takfiris” and “Qutbists” – ready-made categories, as analysts like Salah and Rashwan believe – to try to qualify the new militant groups. \\nMost of the suspects have no political records, something their lawyers have repeatedly stressed. \\nWill not\\xa0a resurgence in violent opposition spill over to the al-Jamaa al-Islamiya? “Not to this generation which leads the al-Jamaa, at least,” replied Zayat. “Maybe the coming generations. Maybe.” \\nTired of serving time\\nRashwan agrees. The old leadership and its loyal middle ranks, have been exhausted by years of incarcerations, and could clearly see that violence was not leading anywhere.\\xa0 At the same time, young cadres, detained at most for short periods, were deprived of contact with the preceding generations and have failed to absorb their changes. \\nA split led by disillusioned youth, if it happens, will be the first major fissure in the al-Jamaa’s history, but could follow well-established patterns set by similar groups.\\n“Such (splinter) movements are usually motivated by youth, inside or outside prison,” explained Zayat. “They seek an elder figure inside prison, who would share their views. They’ll take him as a figurehead to gain legitimacy or guidance, and would cluster their group around him. \\n“This is just what happened in the case of Sayyid Qutb,” he added referring to the executed father of radical Islamic politics in the 1960s. “It’s possible it may occur again.” \\nThe al-Jamaa leaders, including the new “moderates”, are aware of the possible risk. Asked by Asharq Al-Awsat back in March 2002, on whether other violent groups were likely to appear, the Jamaah’s original founder Salah Hashim said: \\n“I hope no other groups appear and drag us into the cycle of violence, from which no one benefits but our enemies … The Egyptian regime has to realise that, and help the al-Jamaa al-Islamiya to go out of this period. We should be given the chance to practice daawa (preaching) so as to achieve stability.”\\n',\n",

Tom Feeney took a shot at the Bush administration, arguing that American taxpayers should not be forced to bear the financial burden for Iraq. \\n“Why should US citizens have to pay one additional penny for this rebuilding when Americans have already paid tens of billions of dollars for the liberation of Iraq with a huge military operation and more preciously, thousands of our own soldiers’ blood?”, Sweeney asked.\\nBecause the money appropriated for Iraq is provided in the form of supplemental spending bills, it’s difficult to make the case that the occupation is draining funds from domestic programs, Rice said.\\n“I don’t think you can really talk in those terms, about robbing Peter to pay Paul.”\\nGrowing deficit\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCriticising the president unlikely to translate into defence cuts\\n\\n\\n\\nCriticising the president unlikely to translate into defence cuts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead, what concerns many economists is the rising level of deficit spending by the Bush administration, something that shows no signs of abating. \\nNext year, the deficit is projected to be roughly $480 billion. If it continues to grow larger, while overall economic growth remains meagre, the government could be forced to cut spending on various federal programs in the years to come, economists say.\\nPresident Bush, already deflecting calls from many congressional Democrats to roll back significant portions of the tax cuts he pushed through, will probably confront a choice between military spending and tax relief, Farrar said.\\n“The real nut crunching, I think, is going to come when we see the direction they go in terms of the taxes…It may well be that members of Congress stand up and say ‘Mr. President, you can’t have both,’” he said.\\nThe likelihood of a reduction in the military budget is remote, said Edward Atkeson, a former Army major general and now a senior fellow at the Institute of Land Warfare at the Association of the US Army, a military think tank. \\nThe political risk in Congress of pushing for defence cuts would be too great at this point, he said.\\n“Anybody doing so would just be so quickly blackballed in political corners,” he said.\\n',\n",

              "       '\\n\\nIn 1992, Hindu extremists\\xa0intent on building a temple on the location they believe marked the birthplace of their deity Rama, demolished the 16th-century Babri mosque. Consequent nationwide religious rioting left 2000 people dead. \\nIn the 1996 elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which was closely associated with the mosque demolition emerged as the largest single party. Two years later, the BJP came into power after forming a coalition government.\\nSince 1991, a\\xa0number of court cases\\xa0have been\\xa0filed relating to different aspects of the dispute.\\xa0Several members of the BJP coalition government were also charged with abetting in the mosque’s destruction. \\nIn the midst of all of this, one ordinary man, Muhammad Aslam Bhure, has found himself at the\\xa0center of\\xa0the legal storm.\\nCourt decisions\\nThe Ayodhya case is being heard in three different courts, namely, the Rae Bareli special court, set up late last year, the UP State High Court in Lucknow, which has been hearing the case since the demolition of the mosque and the Supreme Court in Delhi whose intervention Bhure sought every time he discerned any derailment in the process of law. \\n\\nBhure says the recent order of the Rae Bareli court, discharging India’s deputy prime minister L K Advani but framing charges against his Bharatiya Janata Party colleagues\\xa0 has little or no bearing on the final outcome of his battle.\\n\\n“The order of the Rae Bareili court will just be a footnote in the legal history of the case. It is my review petition filed in January this year against the 38 originally accused in the case, including Advani, that will decide the climax of this case,” he says. \\n“The Supreme Court has already issued notices to the accused in response to my petition which means it has taken my petition seriously. The Rae Bareli court’s order does not weaken my case,” he adds.\\n\\nDocuments\\n\\nBhure is just a matriculate and the only bread-winner of a family of wife and five children, three of them still at school. A cycle rickshaw garage that he owns is his only source of income. The cause\\xa0he has taken up, even by his own reckoning, is too big for him. \\n“I am not the doer, I couldn’t be; it must have been a divine command that a person of my low education and poor income thought of fighting the case,”\\xa0he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nHis modest education, however, hardly seems a handicap. Bhure reels off the details of the cases he has fought for 12 long years–first to save the almost five-century old Babri mosque from demolition, then to get those allegedly involved in the crime punished–without once referring to the piles of documents in his possession. \\xa0Bhure’s struggle to save the Babri mosque, built by the\\xa0Mughal invader Babar and\\xa0which many Hindus believe was\\xa0constructed after demolishing an ancient temple marking the birthplace of their deity Rama, began in 1991 with a petition against the Uttar Pradesh state government.\\n\\n\\n\\nBhure believes he has compelling reasons to continue fighting\\n\\n\\n\\nBhure believes he has compelling reasons to continue fighting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe government sought to acquire the land around the mosque and hand it over to the tourism department, but thanks to Bhure’s petition\\xa0the land was given back to the Wakf Board, the original custodian of the mosque and the land around it. \\nThe court order came five days too late to save the mosque from demolition on 6 December 1992, but it upheld Bhure’s contention that the land on and around which the mosque stood could not be acquired by anyone pending resolution of the title suit over the disputed area. \\nAfter the demolition of the mosque by Hindu zealots, the government acquired the entire six and a half acres of land around the disputed site but was legally bound to protect it against any\\xa0acquisition move. \\nPetition\\nIn March 2002, however, the Vajpayee government, under pressure from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a Hindu organisation, made a move towards handing over a part of the land around the disputed area to a Hindu religious body for building a temple. \\nHowever, it was Bhure’s petition once again, insisting on status quo pending a resolution of the five-decade old title suit, which won the day. \\nBhure believes there is no role for him in the title suit that has remained unresolved since 1950 when the first petition on it was filed in the local courts. A plethora of petitions were filed subsequently but the title suit is nowhere near being resolved. \\nIt is generally believed that, in view of the religious sensitivity of the issue, no court is going to decide it in a hurry. \\n“The demolition of the mosque was a criminal act and if those responsible for it are not punished simply because they are in the government what message would the common people get? That the rule of law is only for them, not for the big shots?” he said.\\nNothing personal\\nBhure insists that there is nothing personal about his petitions against the ruling party members, and as for himself, the fight has left him bankrupt. \\n“I never anticipated that the battle would turn out to be so long, that I would be pitched against the high and mighty of India or that it would leave me impoverished.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am not the doer, I couldn’t be; it must have been a divine command that a person of my low education and poor income thought of fighting the case“\\nMuhammad Aslam Bhure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBhure claims that that he has had to sell off a shop and a part of his house to pay for the legal costs. \\nEvery application in the court, and he has lost count of how many he has filed, leaves him poorer by about $50. And this, despite his lawyer, O P Sharma, not charging him any his fees for his court appearances.\\nHis wife begs him to withdraw but Bhure is in a dilemma. “If I withdraw after having come this far I will be suspected of a sell-out but I do not have the resources, not even the physical strength, to continue,” he says.\\nAn attack of pneumonia, which kept Bhure confined to a hospital bed for 10\\xa0days in August, has also been a big blow. He had to spend $700 of his scarce resources for treatment.\\nCelebrity status\\nTo a question on why his celebrity status, at least in his own area populated by well-off Muslims, has not translated into material or moral help from the community, Bhure says, “A lot of people promised help but no one actually gave it.”\\xa0 \\n“ Now I wish for a speedy end to the cases because I am beginning to feel the pinch.”\\xa0The flesh is weak, the spirit is waning and the only thing that keeps him going, according to Bhure, is his faith. \\n“Even the odds I am facing today must be God’s will,” he says. Not surprising for a man who sees the will of God even in the congenital blindness of both the children of his only sibling, a divorced sister. \\n“But today,” he says,\\xa0 “if, despite receiving threats to my life and holding the mirror up to the politically powerful, I am still alive, I have my mother’s prayers to thank for it.” \\n',\n",

              "       \"\\nThe board of Air France voted on Monday to give a preliminary go-ahead to a tie-up with Dutch carrier KLM that could lead to the first cross-border merger of leading European airlines. \\nAir France and KLM, Europe’s second and fourth-ranked carriers, have held alliance talks for over a year and the groups finally looked set to announce a deal on Tuesday morning. \\nAir France planned to issue a statement at 07:00am (05:00 GMT) after approving a letter of intent to team up with KLM, Yvon Toul, a representative of the CGT union on Air France’s board, told reporters after a board meeting. \\nThird largest\\nThe airline planned another board meeting in two weeks to finalise the deal, Toul said. \\n\\n\\n\\nKLM could be merging soon with the French national carrier\\n\\n\\n\\nKLM could be merging soon with the French national carrier\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKLM declined to confirm that its board held a simultaneous meeting and declined to say if it also backed the agreement. \\nIf approved by regulators, the two will create the world’s third-largest airline in terms of traffic, behind American Airlines and Delta. It would become Europe’s biggest, overtaking British Airways. \\nAlitalia had hoped to be included in the merger of KLM and Air France, its partner in the SkyTeam marketing alliance, but Toul said the Italian state-controlled airline would be left in the cold, at least in the first phase. \\nIn what appeared to be a contradictory statement, Alitalia said its board, which also met on Monday, still gave its Chief Executive Officer Francesco Mengozzi the mandate to sign a three-way deal with the heads of Air France and KLM “in the next few hours.” \\nEffective takeover ..\\nFrench union members, who were briefed on the details of the agreement, said Air France and KLM planned to create a joint holding company that would be supervised by an evenly split committee of eight members, with a tie-breaking vote going to Air France’s chairman. \\n“The strategic committee will decide on all major strategic decisions, including the makeup of of the combined fleet, network and alliance issues,” said Toul. \\nBut he added that the stakes the two airlines will take in the holding company would reflect their respected market valuations, which suggests an effective takeover of KLM by its larger rival. \\nCombined, the two airlines have a market capitalisation of 3.6 billion euros ($4.1 billion), with KLM accounting for 16% of the total. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am waiting with great interest to find out what technique will be used to prevent KLM from losing its ‘Dutchness'” \\nChris Avery, JP Morgan analyst \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe airlines would retain their separate identities, a prerequisite for preserving their international landing rights, and the Dutch government is expected to keep its golden share in KLM for the time being. \\nAir France management told unions at a works council meeting that KLM would retain its flying rights at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport for eight years. \\nGo Dutch\\xa0\\nAnalysts said they were still not certain how a holding structure that gave KLM shareholders a minority stake would prevent the Dutch airline from losing its international landing rights, which are negotiated bilaterally between governments on behalf of their airlines. \\n“I am waiting with great interest to find out what technique will be used to prevent KLM from losing its ‘Dutchness’,” said JP Morgan analyst Chris Avery. \\nAir France shares ended up 1.26% at 13.69 euros while KLM stock was up 0.84% at 11.96 euros. \\nBecause of concerns about preserving the landing rights of each airline the deal will stop short of a full merger, making cost savings more elusive. \\nAir France had estimated a deal to be worth around 400 million euros in synergies over five years but told unions on Monday these benefits would be wort0 million. \\nABN AMRO analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said in a research note that while a tie-up between the two airlines could leave operational staff numbers unchanged, synergies could be had in head-office and marketing functions. \\nA successful Air France/KLM combination could serve as a model for other full-service airlines struggling with an economic slowdown and growing competition from no-frills airlines in an already overcrowded market. \\nEven many governments, which had once seen the existence of flag carriers as a matter of national pride, now recognise the need for consolidation. \\nA tie-up would bring KLM into SkyTeam and pave the way for KLM’s Us partners, Northwest and Continental, to come onboard at a later date. \\n\\nThis would make SkyTeam bigger than the oneworld alliance of carriers led by British Airways and AMR’s American Airlines and narrow the gap between SkyTeam and the top-ranked Star Alliance led by Lufthansa and United Airlines.\\n\",\n",

And Europe, for all its disapproval of Israel, has never imposed any meaningful economic or diplomatic sanction against the Jewish state.\\n\\xa0\\nNeedless to say, the US president has gone back on almost every single admonition towards Israel that he has ever uttered. \\n\\xa0\\nMost notably, the US administration which had considered withholding $8bn worth of loan guarantees from Israel, pending a halt to its settlement expansion in the occupied territories, has now withdrawn the “road map”, which had enjoined\\xa0 both parties to abide by certain terms, making it a blueprint for enjoining Palestinian compliance only.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe change of heart towards the Palestinians that had been gathering pace in the West has now been converted into an impatience with Palestinian “terrorism” and an insistence that their leadership be reformed.\\n\\xa0\\nThe reason for this turnaround, it is alleged, is the wave of so-called “suicide bombing” which has re-enlisted international sympathy for Israel. The latter has been able to exploit the situation with great adroitness, portraying itself as the victim once again and tapping into the Western fear of terrorism.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“the first Intifada, for all its non-violence, achieved no end of Israeli occupation” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFriends of the Palestinians have rushed to warn them against any more of these operations, pointing out that all support for their cause has been dissipated and advising a return to peaceful means of protest. \\n\\xa0\\nThe first Intifada is held up as a model, where civil disobedience was the norm and none of these attacks took place.\\n\\xa0\\nUnsuccessful\\n\\xa0\\nWhat no one points out is that the first Intifada, for all its non-violence, achieved no end of Israeli occupation and no cessation in the Israeli theft of Palestinian land. \\n\\xa0\\nIt did indirectly produce the Oslo Agreement, which, under a veneer of Palestinian autonomy and a peace process, legitimised the Israeli hold on 78% of Mandate Palestine and allowed Israel to go on stealing Palestinian land and resources.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrench President Jacques Chirac:Reached accord with Israel\\n\\n\\n\\nFrench President Jacques Chirac:Reached accord with Israel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe real problem here is the way in which this conflict is viewed. So long as the two parties are seen as equal combatants with equal resources, the Palestinians will be judged as failing.\\n\\xa0\\nThis concept of equivalence even shows in the language used to describe the conflict: terms such as “ceasefire” and “crossfire” apply only to armies, not to one army ranged against a civilian population with a lightly armed police force.\\n\\xa0\\nLikewise, the idea of ‘controlling the militants’ is only meaningful if the Palestinian side were a functioning sovereign state with enforceable powers.\\n\\xa0\\nBoth sides are criticised for claiming equal victimhood, as if the occupier could ever by the victim of the occupied; and of course the whole concept of negotiations between the parties is based on the same premise, as if both sides were equally free and not, as is the case, occupier and occupied.\\n\\xa0\\nUnless the essential fact is grasped that one side has all the power and the other none, Israel will maintain its occupation and Palestinian resistance will be called “terrorism”.\\n\\xa0\\nAnd for that to happen, the international community will have to revise its support for the Zionist project and its connection with its guilt-ridden obsession with Jewish persecution. \\n\\xa0\\nThe charge of anti-semitism has been immensely useful for Israel in its colonisation of Palestine. If the heroic resistance of this Intifada is not to be in vain, the world must confront its obsession with placating Israel and abandon Zionism.\\n\\xa0\\nGhada Karmi is a Palestinian activist and writer.

The defence ministry responded by outing Kelly as the source of the report. Days later on July 18, Kelly’s body was found with a slit wrist in woodland near his home in central England. \\nSecond hand\\nThe Hutton inquiry into his suicide heard that the 45-minute claim referred to weapons fired from artillery or mortars, and not missiles that could hit distant lands. \\nIt also heard over 23 days of testimony during August and September that the source of the 45-minute claim was “second-hand”. \\nHutton is due to publish his findings by the end of November with Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon seen as the likely fall guy over his department’s outing of Kelly. \\nHeap’s 36-year career in the diplomatic service also took in spells as high commissioner to the Bahamas and the British trade commissioner in Hong Kong. \\nHe is the most senior diplomat to give such a detailed and scathing public account of MI6’s behaviour, normally protected by Britain’s Official Secrets Act, The Guardian said. \\nHeap told the daily that Britain’s senior embassy staff see all of MI6’s raw intelligence reports filed to London but are powerless to veto them even if their accuracy is doubted. \\n\\n',\n",

It should go to a man.’ That’s why there are fewer women in the race,” said Abri, 37. \\nConfidence\\nIncumbent Lujaina Mohsen Darwish, a businesswoman and scion of a prominent family, was more confident, saying she had a good chance to retain her seat in the capital and hoped to have more female colleagues in the new council. \\n“People know me.

Our next exhibitor has some highly graphic works of him and his wife in bed together- he knows we cannot hang those up.”\\nEarly days\\nBut the contemporary art market is still in its early stages. According to Wallace, 99% of all buyers are foreigners. \\n“People are buying art for aesthetic reasons only; there is currently no second hand market for these works.

If artists totally abandon the public and work only for the international audience then there is a problem. \\nAn event like the biennale creates a market where artists are focused on welcoming international buyers rather than seriously engaging with representing modern Chinese culture,” he said. \\nKnowing your audience\\nThe problem of reaching out to the public is compounded by the poverty of many artists, and subsequent attraction of trying to create something that has wider appeal, even if that means sacrificing artistic originality and cultural heritage.\\n“There are only eight or nine original artists in Beijing, the rest copy or are in the process of learning,” says Sheng Qi, a painter and performance artist. The latter is the one genre of art still prohibited by government officials. \\nLu Jie says: “Art in China is ahistorical-we play with politics and history, we don’t really examine or engage with it.”\\nSheng Qi who, following\\xa0a June 1989 crackdown, cut off a finger in protest, said: “Most of these artists are not really artists, they do not understand art.” \\nBudding work\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFactory 798: Newly foundedbohemian art district in Beijing\\n\\n\\n\\nFactory 798: Newly foundedbohemian art district in Beijing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFactory 798, with its still intact Mao Zedong slogans emphasizing Marxist-Leninist thought contrasting sharply with chic fashion shows and futurist sculpture, is seen as a symbol of what contemporary art can become. \\nThe government, long a thorn in the side of anything that had even a hint of controversy, has gradually been realizing this.\\n“Rather than ignoring galleries and curators as was the case in the past, the government is trying to co-opt us.

Unless whoever is behind the leak comes forward with what they know, the investigation is unlikely to produce any criminal indictments, Farrar said.\\nThe question is “how far can you squeeze these people to cough up and say ‘I did it’?” he said.\\nNames known\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“(Karl Rove) was not involved, and that allegation is not true in terms of leaking classified information, nor would he condone it”\\nScott McClellan,White House press secretary \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, media reports indicate that several individuals, other than Novak, know the names of the officials who leaked the story, something that makes it much more difficult to keep the truth from coming out, said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a DC-based think tank. \\n“I would assume that this should be a pretty easy one to track down,” Hess said.\\nThe Washington Post reported that, besides Novak, at least six other journalists received the information about Wilson’s wife, and a senior administration official told the paper that two White House officials leaked the story. \\nWilson himself said several reporters informed him that White House officials had knowledge of the leak.\\nWhite House press secretary Scott McClellan said the White House staff would fully cooperate with the Justice Department, but denied Rove had anything to do with the leak.\\n“He was not involved, and that allegation is not true in terms of leaking classified information, nor would he condone it,” McClellan said.\\nCheney’s or Rice’s people\\nWhile it is\\xa0still too early to tell whether the White House was involved, fingers are starting to point in the direction of Vice President Dick Cheney’s\\xa0office. \\nThe VP’s office asked the CIA in early 2002 to look into the veracity of US intelligence on Iraq’s uranium dealings in Africa, a request that led the agency to send Wilson to Niger. \\n“It’s as likely as anything that [the leak] came from the VP’s office as from anywhere else in the White House,” Farrar said.\\n\\xa0The White House official said there was no information to suggest that anyone on the Vice President’s staff played a role in the leak.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCondoleezza Rice\\xa0pleads ignorance of the affair\\n\\n\\n\\nCondoleezza Rice\\xa0pleads ignorance of the affair\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother possible scenario is that someone on the National Security Council (NSC), headed by Bush’s National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, leaked the story as a means of exacting revenge against Wilson for publicly stating that the administration’s intelligence claims were false, he said.\\n“It would not surprise me that these sources may not have been on the political side of the White House, but may have been on the national security side and had an axe to grind,” he said.\\nNSC staff members would have more access to classified intelligence than Bush aides working in the West Wing, he said.\\nThe use of classified intelligence for political reasons is at the heart of the current controversy, Gibney said.\\n“I think for me what is disturbing about the scandal is that it shows a continuing reckless, self-serving disregard for the handling of classified material by the Bush administration,” he said.\\nTroubling\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBush’s tight ship has sprung several leaks\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBush’s tight ship has sprung several leaks\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor an administration that prides itself on having a leak-proof public image, the notion that one of its own officials, whether inside or outside of the White House, disclosed sensitive information to the media is troubling to President Bush.\\n“There’s just too many leaks, and if there is a leak out of my administration, I want to know who it is,” Bush said on Tuesday during a news conference in Chicago. “If the person violated the law, the person will be taken care of. And I welcome the investigation.”\\nSenior White House officials could surely find classified material on undercover agents if they went looking for it, said Jennifer Kibbe, an expert in covert action at the Brookings Institution.\\n“Particularly, if it is someone at the level about which the allegations are being made, I think that they could have had access to the information and wouldn’t have needed someone at CIA to get it,” Kibbe said.\\nWhistleblowers warned\\nWilson said during an interview with Aljazeera.net in mid-August that the leak was less about discrediting him or his wife, and more about sending a message that any future whistleblowers would face the wrath of the administration.\\n“The idea that the administration, at the political level, would go after my wife or sort of drag her name into this, by her maiden name, was clearly designed to keep others from stepping forward,” Wilson said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Especially for this person (Wilson’s wife), it’s over” Jay Farrar, Vice president of external affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough it is\\xa0still unclear whether Wilson’s wife was working in a covert capacity or was merely an analyst for the CIA, those with knowledge of the intelligence business say she will never be able to work undercover in the future.\\n“Especially for this person, it’s over,” Farrar said.\\nThe reputation of the CIA itself may be damaged by the publicity surrounding the leak, something that could harm its ability to conduct future intelligence-gathering operations involving foreign contacts, Kibbe said.\\n“If you’re one of those foreign sources who is considering contacting the CIA, are you going to think twice about contacting the CIA? Sure,” she said. “If there’s a risk that this kind of information will be disclosed, that’s huge.”\\nThat could be one of the reasons why the CIA made sure its request for an investigation was picked up by the media, Farrar said.\\n“The reality is that people at the agency feel that they’re whip-sawed back and forth,” he said. \\nWhether or not Bush will take a sustained political hit from the investigation depends on how forthcoming the White House is with information in the weeks ahead, political analysts say. \\nIf the administration is seen to be actively cooperating with investigators, it could whether the storm relatively unscathed, Hess said.\\n“If they have a very tough investigation and move very quickly, it can be dealt with,” he said.\\n',\n",

              "       'The Israeli army clampdown on the movement of Palestinians raised tension already high due to the continued erection of\\xa0the apartheid wall and Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank. \\n“Based on a decision by the political authorities and the assessment of the situation, a complete closure of Judea and Samaria (West Bank) and the Gaza Strip will start on Friday … through to the Yom Kippur,” which ends on Monday night, Israel’s army said in a statement. \\nThe holiday – during which airports, ports and borders are closed – is the holiest in Judaism. \\nWall extension\\nIsrael also appeared determined to extend the apartheid wall which will cut deep into the West Bank despite criticism from its US ally and fierce condemnation from the Palestinians. \\nA first section of the barrier, which is aimed at preventing infiltrations by Palestinian resistance fighters, was completed in July and the Israeli cabinet has just approved the phased construction of the next part. \\nKeen not to draw the ire of the White House, which has been unusually outspoken in its criticism of the project, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s government decided not include large settlement blocs inside the main barrier. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe apartheid wall near the West Bank town of Jenin\\n\\n\\n\\nThe apartheid wall near the West Bank town of Jenin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, separate horseshoe-shaped fences will be erected around the settlements which will be linked later up to the main barrier, meaning a de facto annexing of large swathes of land or splitting Palestinian villages in two. \\nAccording to B’Tselem, the main Israeli group monitoring human rights in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, some 11,000 Palestinians will end up on the Israeli side of the barrier, while some 72,000 will be surrounded by fences on both sides. \\nIn addition, the estimated 250,000 Palestinians who live in east Jerusalem will be cut off from the rest of the West Bank. \\nHamas unbowed\\nThe Palestinian resistance group Hamas vowed on Friday that the wall would not put a stop to its attacks, including suicide bombings. \\n“The wall built by Israel will not stop the operations and we will succeed in breaching it,” the Islamic group’s representative in Lebanon, Usama Hamdan, told hundreds of supporters at a southern Palestinian refugee camp. \\nWashington, has threatened economic sanctions over the barrier, which it fears will complicate negotiations on the Palestinian state it has committed itself to. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe army has started loosening the rules of engagement in the vicinity of the fence, making it easier for soldiers to open fire on suspects approaching it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn another defiant move which Washington has promised to punish by deducting money from huge loan guarantees for Israel, Sharon’s government announced that tenders had been issued for building more than 550 new homes in West Bank Jewish settlements. \\nRussia also called on Israel to stop the construction of its “security barrier” in Palestinian territory and halt the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. \\nAnti-peace efforts\\nPalestinian president Yasir Arafat condemned the Israeli decisions, describing the barrier as the “wall of racism” while other Palestinians officials also denounced both decisions as an Israeli attempt to sabotage peace efforts and the two-state vision promoted by Washington. \\nBut the Palestinians lack a strong voice with the United States: prime minister-designate Ahmad Quraya is still struggling to form his new government. \\nQuraya again postponed the official presentation of the new cabinet line-up, which is expected to be announced on Wednesday and include only half the number of ministers

peaceful settlement and intends to unilaterally determine borders and prevent the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. \\n“Without the creation, within the June 4 (1967) borders, of a geographically continuous Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, there will be no solution with the Israelis,” said the premier. \\nIsrael argues that the barrier is crucial to its security,

              "       'Only last week the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Turkey desk chief, Reza Moghadam, told reporters “the Turkish economy is on the right track”. \\nThis, he said, demonstrated the effectiveness of the IMF backed economic programme the country has been following since the financial crisis two years ago.\\nIn 2001, the Turkish lira halved in value overnight, interest rates soared and unemployment sky-rocketed after a major banking crisis. The country’s economy shrank by 9.4% that year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll these factors ”indicate that the 2001 crisis is finally over” \\nAnalyst at Garanti Securities \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrency appreciation\\nSince May this year, the lira has appreciated 20% against the US dollar, interest rates have more than halved and both international &amp; domestic investment has risen. Unemployment has also fallen to an historic low of 15%.\\n”It all indicates that the 2001 crisis is finally over,” said an analyst at Garanti Securities who declined to be named. \\nThe strengthening lira has been good news for Turkey’s debt servicing. With most debt denominated in US dollars, the weakening dollar has lightened the country’s giant public debt burden which stands at $187 billion.\\nInternational confidence in the Turkish economy was further strengthened on 9 September when public sector workers called off a hunger strike aimed at securing higher annual pay awards. \\nHad the strike continued the government would likely have been forced to stray from the IMF’s strictly monitored stipulations.\\nOutstanding risks\\nNevertheless, all this good news could be in jeopardy. Two political and international disputes threaten new found investor confidence. \\nThe first of these is the latest chapter in the long running conflict surrounding Turkey’s ethnic Kurds, while the second is the US-led war in neighbouring Iraq. \\nOn Monday, a Turkish court ruled that the country’s largest legal pro-Kurdish political party DEHAP had broken electoral rules during last year’s national vote.\\nOfficials will now have to decide whether to annul the results of last November’s elections – along with all the legislation passed by the government since then. A fresh nation-wide ballot would then have to be held.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n”We’re all waiting to see what they decide.

This would dilute the ruling party’s majority, potentially swinging the political bias of the legislature.\\nAlternatively, they could decide to simply fine DEHAP, most likely sending its leaders to jail. Still, the political instability that the court’s decision could result in is giving the markets the\\xa0jitters.\\n”We’re all waiting to see what they decide,” says economist Refik Ulusoy of Istanbul’s Bosphorus University. “The economy is doing well at the moment, but if there is a call for fresh elections, then the instability this will cause will send markets tumbling.”\\nThe court’s decision prompted the Istanbul Stock Exchange to fall 3.7%, the lira to slide 0.84% against the dollar and the yield on the benchmark May 2004 bond to rise 300 basis points to 35%.\\nIraq risk\\nThe conflict in neighbouring Iraq also threatens to derail Turkish economic growth.\\nThe US has requested Turkey deploy its troops under coalition command in the war-torn country, a move that Turkey’s leaders support. They see it as a good way to patch up relations with the Americans after they failed to support the US-led invasion of Iraq in March.\\nTurkey’s decision to stay out back then led to the loss of an aid package estimated to be worth as much as $20 billion. Now however, another sizeable US economic package is on offer.\\nLast week, the US announced that it would loan $8.5 billion to Turkey at the Dubai IMF summit. While both Ankara and Washington have since denied that there is any link between this money and Turkish military support in Iraq, financial analysts are distrustful.\\n“Of course there must be conditions attached,” says Istanbul businessman Cevik Ezran, whose textile company recently began hiring workers for the first time since 2001. “For there not to be would go against the whole way international politics is conducted.”\\nUS loan package\\nNews that the $8.5 billion loan was agreed was initially greeted with a surge in Turkish markets. Since then, further statements from the Turkish government have cast doubt on whether Turkey will commit troops to support the US-led coalition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yet looking at history, it seems that whenever there was a chance for the authorities to make the wrong decision, they made it”\\nAnalyst at Bender Securities, Istanbul\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking on 18 September, Prime Minister Recip Tayyip Erodgan appeared to move away from his original support for sending troops unconditionally by saying, ”Undoubtedly, we would like to see UN leadership in Iraq in the first place.” \\nMeanwhile, political analysts in Ankara are suggesting that if the Turkish parliament were to vote on troop deployment, the motion would fail, perhaps sinking the $8.5 billion loan along with it.\\n”These are the hot issues now,” said an analyst for Istanbul based Bender Securities.\\nStorm clouds\\n“Behind DEHAP and Iraq the economy is in better shape. The lira is strong, which is helping bring down inflation and interest rates, while low labour costs and a strong Euro mean that the impact on Turkish exports has not been that severe,” he added.\\n”However, if either issue develops, then we could see a rush out of lira, inflation going back up and interest rates climbing, with a lot of the good work that’s been done coming undone.”\\nThe looming threats have left Turkey’s markets nervously awaiting resolution.\\n”We can’t say for sure what will be the decision in either case,” the analyst continued. “Yet looking at history, it seems that whenever there was a chance for the authorities to make the wrong decision, they made it.”\\n',\n",

Under the draft, decisions on most policy areas except defence, foreign policy and taxation will be adopted if backed by at least half the member states representing at least 60 percent of the EU’s population. \\nThis would replace the current system of weighted voting, under which each member state has an allocation of votes imperfectly reflecting the size of its population. \\nSpain and Poland are leading the fight to preserve the existing system. The Nice treaty, negotiated in 2000, gave each of them, with a population of about 40 million, 27 votes, compared with 29 for each of the EU’s Big Four of Germany, Britain, France and Italy, with far larger populations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpanish\\xa0PM Jose Maria Aznar does not want to lose his voting advantage\\n\\n\\n\\nSpanish\\xa0PM Jose Maria Aznar does not want to lose his voting advantage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the first session of Saturday’s summit, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said he remains opposed to proposed changes to voting rights. \\nAlong with incoming EU member Poland, Spain is holding out to keep the voting rights it secured under the 2000 Nice Treaty, which give both countries 27 votes against 29 for Germany, which is twice the size.\\n“There is no consensus on this issue. We are going to maintain this position,” Aznar told reporters.\\nHis Polish allies may have lost their will to fight, as Warsaw now accepts that the present voting system in the European Union may be changed before 2009, the date at which the new constitution would come into effect. \\nThe daily Rzeczpospolita paper quotes Foreign Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz as acknowledging that the terms of the Nice Treaty “are not eternal” and if they proved unsuitable negotiations could begin on modifying them between now and 2009. \\nInclusion of God\\nAnother key issue confronting ministers is that of religion.

It could be a divisive one. It depends on the text. We shall have to wait and see,” he told reporters. \\nDefence\\nAnother area of fierce debate is that of defence. The draft contains a general solidarity clause providing for mutual assistance in case of a terrorist attack. It would also allow those states that wished to do so to subscribe to a collective defence clause. \\nSome countries, notably Britain, see this as encroaching on NATO’s role.

For example, they don’t want so much rice as this contains both sugar and starch … this did not happen before,” says Eric Lau, a restaurant manager at Summer Palace, one of Beijing’s leading Cantonese restaurants. \\nDoing a brisk trade in such specialties as shark’s fin soup, he has noticed how people now stress the health effects of their meal. \\n“We always knew shark’s fin soup was good for the body – it is full of important minerals – now our customers are aware of this too.”\\nA greater awareness of dietary effects on the body has become one of the side effects improved education is bringing. \\n“I don’t eat bird’s nest too often,” said one customer who introduced himself as Mr Yang, “as it contains too much protein for regular consumption.” \\nBird’s nest soup, a delicacy reputedly brought to China by the Zheng He during the Qing Dynasty is believed by some to be extremely beneficial for the body. \\n“After falling sick, eat the soup to internally cleanse your body,” says Stanley Yuen, head chef at Summer Palace, “it will wash your organs and remove any traces of disease.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Like the West, people are eating more and exercising less.”\\nProfessor Chen Junshi,Chinese Centre for Disease Control\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome are not convinced. \\n“There is no science in such logic,” cautions Professor Chen Junshi of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control (CDC). “It is true people are looking more at their diet but this kind of traditional logic should not be relied upon.”\\nFolklore\\xa0under scrutiny\\nReferring to the opinion of Chef Yuen who bases his opinions on centuries of culinary and medicinal experience rather than modern day science, Chen prefers to look at facts as they appear under a microscope. \\n“There is much in traditional Chinese dietary history that works but we do need to prove it scientifically, then as scientists, we can talk about progress,” he says.\\nOne area of interest is the notion of “hot” and “cold” foods. \\nOften referred to as yin and yang, a good chef aims to balance both throughout the course of a meal.\\nAn imbalance of yang, often characterised by hot, spicy foods can result in spotty skin, sore throat and poor digestion whereas too much yin leads to low blood pressure – a naturally occurring condition in women during menstruation.\\n“For example, if you have a cold or fever, you should take ginger as part of a soup. We do not know the exact science for this but it has been proved to work. It is a kind of belief but without scientific justification,” says Chen.\\nDiseases of affluence\\nGreater knowledge about the scientifically dubious qualities of Chinese food is one aspect of how people are taking a greater interest in what they eat.\\nBut according to Chen, people’s diets are changing in other less healthy ways, caused in part by Western culinary influences. \\n“People are eating more food, especially more animal products. This is leading to problems of obesity, heart disease and cancer … what we in China call diseases of affluence.”\\nAs meat has become affordable and cooked in ever-increasing amounts of oil, the effects are noticeable. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWestern eating habits\\xa0threaten to\\xa0plump up Chinese children\\n\\n\\n\\nWestern eating habits\\xa0threaten to\\xa0plump up Chinese children\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Children are defiantly getting fatter … with only one child in a family how can a family refuse their only child’s wish to have an ice-cream, especially when they can afford it,” said Chen. \\nIn Beijing, according to the CDC, over 20% of adults are obese, including 50% of women over 40. “Like the West, people are eating more and exercising less,” added Chen.\\nFor the CDC, such changes are unwelcome. \\n“The current plant-based diet is much healthier … what we need is better education aimed at introducing the dangers of heavy meat and sugar consumption to children … we need to overcome generations of Chinese that have equated meat with luxury … the problem is, there are so many aspects of health education to deal with; AIDS, hepatitis, tuberculosis – diet and nutrition are very minor topics compared with these issues.”\\nWhile SARS may have brought some reduction in the eating of wild animals, the full impact of health awareness on people’s diets has yet to be felt. \\nOne thing is clear – last year’s revelation that a restaurant in central China was using human breast milk as a sauce base for a popular dish, certainly shows that when it comes to the unusual, Chinese chefs can put a price on almost anything.\\n',\n",

              "       'An easy decision and a foregone conclusion, you might think. Not so, say the polls.\\nDavis, a Democrat, is not giving up without a fight – even though his main rival is the muscle-bound Hollywood mega star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, described as a moderate Republican. And, this being California, other candidates include a watermelon-throwing comedian, a porn actress, a bounty hunter, and someone called Michael Jackson.\\nMoreover, the 7 October vote is itself not entirely straightforward and has even confused many Californians.\\nWhat exactly are people voting for?\\nThere are effectively two votes and the ballot paper will have two sections. First, Californians can vote for or against the recall. If a majority of voters oppose the recall, Davis will remain governor. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernor Gray Davis raises his fist as he fights to save his job\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernor Gray Davis raises his fist as he fights to save his job\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut if the majority chooses to remove Davis, the focus then falls on the second part of the ballot. In this section, voters select their preferred candidate to replace Davis. Whoever wins the most votes here becomes the next governor.\\nCalifornians can vote against the recall and still name a replacement in case the majority weighs against Davis. \\nHistory is on Davis’ side. The governor of North Dakota, recalled in 1921, is the only one to ever be voted out of office in a gubernatorial recall election.\\nHow many candidates are there?\\nNearly 250 hopefuls initially signed up last month, but the certification process quickly weeded out more than 100 prospective candidates. \\nSadly, 100-year-old Mathilda Spak was one of them, after electoral officials declared she did not have the necessary 65 signatures to qualify for the ballot. But officials still cleared an impressive list of 135 contestants to stand in the election. Most of them are still in it.\\nWhy so many?\\nMost candidates know they have little hope of winning but many simply want their issues recognised. Indeed, one candidate – a homosexual lawyer called Ronald Palmieri – has declared he won’t even vote for himself. He just wants to highlight the threat to gay rights the election poses if a conservative Republican wins. \\n\\n\\nSeveral community activists want to press single issues dear to their hearts, such as workers’ rights, abortion rights and gun control. But only three or four candidates have the remotest chance of winning. \\nThe conservative challenge to the Democrat incumbent started out heavily split. Several serious Republicans were opposed to each other, declaring their fellow right-wingers as too conservative, too liberal, too inexperienced or just plain unelectable. As the election draws near, however, some have dropped out. The rest should increasingly fall behind one or two leading candidates.\\nCan Davis hold on?\\nAlthough the governor is highly unpopular, presiding over severe economic troubles and a deeply indebted state treasury, he might just sneak back in. Many voters, including some non-Democrats, are against the recall election – especially as Davis was only voted in last November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGray Davis (R) and his possible successor Cruz Bustamante (L)\\n\\n\\n\\nGray Davis (R) and his possible successor Cruz Bustamante (L)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the Democrat field has been a little more disciplined than their main rivals. Most influential Democrats have united behind Davis – though many are clearly uncomfortable about backing someone apparently mounting the steps of the guillotine. \\nBut if, as the polls suggest,\\xa0Davis is ejected, his deputy will assume the role of Democrat champion. Polls show Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante enjoys more popularity among voters than his boss does, which could keep the governorship in Democrat hands. That represents a kind of compromise that appeals to many Democrats and people who can’t make up their minds. And Bustamente knows it.\\nWhat about the Terminator?\\nHollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger enjoys the broadest appeal thanks to his celebrity status and, say the opinion polls,\\xa0has the best chance. But a more conservative Republican,\\xa0Senator Tom McClintock, is also in the race for the governorship and taking potential votes away from Arnie.\\nArnie has improved his chances by hiring some interesting advisors: notably former US Treasury boss and multimillionaire Warren Buffet plus former Secretary of State Caspar Weinberger. Fellow acting star and convicted cocaine addict Rob Lowe has also touted his support, though the value of Lowe’s contribution is less clear.\\nThanks to some revealing moments in his Terminator films, Arnie could thus become the first US governor whom everyone has seen naked … assuming porn actress Mary Carey doesn’t win, of course.\\n',\n",

I’ve been blacklisted from all airlines,” Raissi told the BBC.\\nTimothy Pinto, lawyer for the Mail on Sunday, said the newspaper apologised to Raissi for any distress caused.\\nVindication\\nHis lawyers said in a statement he and his wife were “pleased to have got vindication of their reputation from a section of the media which failed to treat him fairly whilst wild accusations were being levelled at him by the US government and in the extradition proceedings.” \\n“Now he can start to rebuild his life by restoring his good reputation through the courts both here and in the United States, where he has commenced proceedings against the FBI and the US Department of Justice,” the statement said.\\nHe is claiming damages from those US agencies for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.\\n',\n",
              "       'He told me that I was exaggerating the risks; that there was nothing to be afraid of because he was a reporter, an objective witness, neither on this nor on\\xa0that side, and because of that was protected by world protocol. \\nHe bid us farewell, apologising for having been so busy. He promised to make it up to me and our daughter, Fatimah, when he returned. \\nTariq left for Aljazeera’s Baghdad office on 5 April. He called me when he arrived – the journey was hellish, he said. He sounded exhausted, because he was sleeping only three hours a day, between shifts. \\n\\nAgony of waiting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI couldn’t cry, I was just listening to the news, seeing again and again all through the day how the Americans bombed the Aljazeera office and killed my husband.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBack home in Jordan, our life was’nt any better; we could hardly sleep, and sat mesmerised in front of the TV waiting for Tareq to appear in a live report so we’d know he was OK. \\n\\nOn the early morning of 8 April, I was still awake at\\xa0six and saw his last live report, in which he described the situation in Baghdad as being very calm and quiet. \\n\\nI was relieved and went to sleep, only to wake up one hour later to the sound of my mother crying and yelling. \\n\\nAt first, I did’nt\\xa0know what had happened. I brought a chair and sat trembling in front of the TV. The house was suddenly full of people. I couldn’t see or hear anyone. I was waiting for the film to end. \\n\\nI was waiting for the hero to appear and end all evil. I was waiting for the story of my life to end with “and they lived happily ever after”. I couldn’t cry, I was just listening to the news, seeing again and again all through the day how the Americans bombed the Aljazeera office and killed my husband. \\n\\nQuestioning beliefs\\n\\nI teach English translation. Once, when I was lecturing on the translation of political terminology, with reference to the UN charter and the declaration of human rights, one of the students said: “How can the US say that this war has a noble cause and a humane agenda? All the dictionary definitions of war involve bloodshed and overwhelming destruction.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTell me, please, what should I do when my daughter, just 20 months old, starts calling her late father’s name and looking for him all around the house? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother student joined in: “Don’t tell us about charters and so-called noble missions, what we see is what we believe.” The whole class cheered; I had nothing to say. \\n\\nI used to tell my students that the American dream is best described as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now I am convinced my students were right and I was\\xa0wrong. I learned the hard way when the Americans ruined my life, confiscated my liberty and ended my happiness. \\n\\nThe real target\\n\\nThe US bombed Aljazeera because it was angered by reports that did not confirm its one-sided picture of the war. \\n\\nFor the past five years, Aljazeera and other Arab stations have been gaining credibility and fame not only in the Arab countries, but also in the west, competing with international networks such as the BBC and CNN. \\n\\nAljazeera in particular became very popular during the American war on Afghanistan. The channel aired voice recordings of al-Qaida and Taliban leaders as well as the speeches of President Bush and allied leaders. \\n\\nThis decision to broadcast both sides was in keeping with its motto – “Opinion and counter-opinion” – but the Americans could not allow such freedom of expression to prevail. \\n\\nThe US sent its first warning to Aljazeera in November 2001, bombing its Kabul office, destroying its equipment and forcing its journalists to flee. An Aljazeera cameraman was sent to Guantanamo Bay as a war prisoner. \\n\\nCovering up crimes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJazeera’s Kabul office also paid theprice for reporting US invasions\\n\\n\\n\\nJazeera’s Kabul office also paid theprice for reporting US invasions \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Baghdad during the war, the coverage of Aljazeera again focused mainly on the daily suffering and loss of ordinary people; and again the Americans wanted their crimes and atrocities to pass unnoticed. \\nThe two bombs they dropped on Aljazeera’s Baghdad office were the ones that killed my husband. Then the Americans opened fire on Abu Dhabi television, whose identity was spelled out in large blue letters on the roof. \\n\\nThe next target was the Palestine hotel, the headquarters of world media representatives – an American tank fired a shell and two more journalists were killed. Thus the US tried to conceal evidence of its crimes from the world and kill the witnesses. \\n\\nThe US didn’t take responsibility for the attacks, claiming that all three were mistakes and insisting that it did not know the whereabouts of journalists, apart from those “embedded” with its troops. \\n\\nPrecise coordinates\\n\\nLater, Aljazeera’s director confirmed that it had given the precise location of the station’s Baghdad office to the Pentagon three months before the war. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaysir Alouni – the latest victim ofreporting news the US governmentdoes not want to hear\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy husband and the others were killed in broad daylight, in locations known to the Pentagon as media sites. \\n\\nThe US was not content with the message it sent to Aljazeera signed with the blood of my husband; it accused the media organisation and other Arab channels of anti-American bias in their coverage of the war. \\n\\nBut how biased can a picture of dead people be? A picture of a destroyed house doesn’t need a reporter to tell its story, and the tears of children and refugees need no interpreter. \\n\\nDealing with death\\n\\nTell me, please, what should I do when my daughter, just 20 months old, starts calling her late father’s name and looking for him all around the house? \\n\\nWhat should I do when the clock strikes five and I keep waiting for Tariq to open the door with his smiling face but he never comes in? When the only way to have some rest is to cry myself to sleep? \\n\\nWhen I see my mother-in-law vomiting four times in less than half an hour? When my daughter brings her toys to play with me, as she used to do with her father, and I can’t even hold her? When my tears fall on my daughter’s face when I give her milk, remembering how her father used to do it? When I feel ruined and desperate, with no hope in life? \\n\\nHow should I raise my daughter? Allow me to answer the last question. I will raise her never to forgive or forget. Never to forget her father and never to forgive those who killed him. \\n\\nPursuing justice\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy life and happiness came to an end on 8 April, but I still have one last dream …\\xa0those who committed the cold-blooded murder of her father and my husband are brought to justice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSix months have passed since the killing of Tariq, and those responsible for his death are still in control, claiming ethical supervision of the world, and basking in their military achievements. \\n\\nThe attacks on Aljazeera continue – Iraq’s US-appointed governing council has just warned the station that if it continues to “misbehave”, its licence in Iraq will be revoked. \\n\\nMeanwhile, an Aljazeera correspondent, Taysir Alouni – the only television journalist who had a live link from Taliban Kabul, and a survivor of both the Kabul and Baghdad bombings – has been accused of helping al-Qaida and the Taliban. \\n\\nWhen he went to Spain to obtain his PhD, he was arrested by the Spanish authorities, widely believed to have been at the behest of the Americans. He is now in a high-security prison awaiting trial, despite there being no concrete evidence against him. \\n\\nHope remains\\n\\nAs for me, six months have passed since my husband’s death and I can’t find anyone to help me to launch legal action against those who killed him. When I thought I had found an outlet under Belgian law, US threats and ultimatums got the law repealed and put an end to my hopes of gaining justice. \\n\\nWhen the Muslim Association of Britain invited me to speak at last weekend’s anti-war march in London, I hesitated because of the despair I have been in. \\n\\nBut when I saw all these people marching against the war, condemning those responsible for it, my hope and belief in the solidarity of humankind, in humanity, justice and truth was rekindled. \\n\\nMy life and happiness came to an end in April, but I still have one last dream; that my Fatimah will have a better future full of love and security, that her heart and mind as well as mine will be relieved when those who committed the cold-blooded murder of her father and my husband are brought to justice. \\n\\nDima Tariq Tahboub is a lecturer at the Arab Open University in Amman and the widow of Tariq Ayyoub, an Aljazeera correspondent\\xa0 \\n',\n",

At least one is the size of California – but because they are surrounded by ice, they are impossible to see by ship. \\nFor this reason, satellite data was used to analyse the plant life in these areas, said Gert van Dijken of Stanford University. \\n“A lot of these polynyas have never been studied, you can’t see them from boats,” van Dijken said. “The only way to study them is by satellite.” \\nSatellite assistance\\n\\n\\n\\nSatellite images helped scientistsfind warm ‘oases’ in Antarctica\\n\\n\\n\\nSatellite images helped scientistsfind warm ‘oases’ in Antarctica\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We used different kinds of satellites to look at the sea ice so we could see how much open water there was, and we used the ocean colour sensor, to look at the colour of the ocean.” \\nUsing a special formula, researchers figured out that if the water was green, it was chock full of phytoplankton, the tiny plants that nourish minuscule shrimp-like creatures called krill. \\nKrill are on the menu for many larger Antarctic creatures, notably the Adelie penguins whose population thrives on some of these oases, van Dijken said. \\nBecause there was plenty of krill to eat, the Adelie penguins could stay close by instead of going long distances to search for food, which would expose them to predators and other natural dangers, the scientists found. \\nThe researchers used data from two satellites: NASA’s Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution\\xa0 Radiometer. \\nThis research appeared in a recent edition of the Journal of Geophysical Research.
