#Control Structures
#Conditional Control Structures
#Iterative

#Control Structures: It determines the order in which programs are executed
# a) Skip some programs while executing other -> condition
# b) Repeat the execution of some codes -> looping
# By default: Python performs a sequential control structure, codes don't have indentations

print("Python")
print("Python")
print("Python")
print("Python")
# c) Control Structures: Codes are executed based on conditions -> if, if...else, if..elseif..else
